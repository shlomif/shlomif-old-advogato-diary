Freecell Solver-wise, I <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/fc-solve-discuss/message/450">busted the warnings</a>
I encountered in the KDE compilation inside the CVS development version. Then
I worked a bit on <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/fc-solve-discuss/message/451">Kpat 
    Integration</a>, and made sure the solver instances are recycled.


<p> <p>
I also worked on the Syscalltrack home-site. I sent a message to a web-design
mailing list I am a member of to find out if the various versions of Microsoft
Internet Explorer, view it with the proper top vertical alignment. I already
received several inputs that they did, so I assumed the report I got was 
singular.


<p> <p>
After that, I got a green light to merge my CVS branch into the HEAD, but was
told to watch for a change that <a href="/person/mulix/">mulix</a> did to the HEAD involving
the logo. I applied his change, and then used the <tt>cvs update -j</tt> command
to integrate my changes. There were some conflicts there, which I resolved 
manually. And then I re-built and uploaded the site.


<p> <p><b>Reading</b> 

<p> <p>
In "Programming Perl" I finished the chapter about Security, and am now
in the middle of the chapter about idiomatic programming, which is very 
interesting.


<p> <p><b>Life</b>

<p> <p>
There were more trouble with the bicycle. As much as I tried to pump air
into them I could not, and I tried two different pumps with both wheels.
When my dad returned home, he again was able to pump air there, and said the
trick was screwing them till the end, and pumping very hard and till the end.


<p> <p>
I did manage to walk at quarter to four. In any case, since I jogged the day 
before yesterday, then yesterday my feet muscles became sore, and they might be sore today as well.


<p> <p>
It rained tonight, and the weather forecast said there are going to be local
rains today. I don't know if it would be a good idea to go biking today.
