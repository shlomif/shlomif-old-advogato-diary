<p><b>Solving the smb mount problem</b>

<p> <p> <p>
I had a problem with my Mandrake installation that after upgrading to 
Mandrake 9.2, I could not mount SMB partitions with the mount command. I tried
to look at the source of the mount command, but the util-linux package
is very hard to build with debug flags. (I could not figure how to do it within
my time frame).


<p> <p> <p>
But <tt>strace</tt> came to the rescue and I was able to find out it was
looking for a <tt>/sbin/mount.smbfs</tt> program. Since I only had 
<tt>/sbin/mount.smbfs2</tt> I symlinked to it, and then everything worked 
properly.


<p> <p> <p><b>Installing dbxml</b>

<p> <p> <p>
One day I set out on trying to install Berkeley dbxml. Problem is it had
several dependencies: Berkeley DB with the C++ bindings, Apache's Xerces, 
and Pathan, an XPath library for Xerces. Compiling Berkeley DB with the C++
bindings went very smoothly (I just had to tweak my configuration script a 
bit). I was also able to compile Xerces as an RPM from its tar.gz.


<p> <p> <p>
Then I set out to install Pathan. I tried to compile the .src.rpm but I 
encountered two problems. The first was 
<a href="http://bugs.decisionsoft.com/show_bug.cgi?id=3192">a compilation 
    problem that was only encountered on gcc 3.3.x</a> (which I have). I was 
able to resolve it based on the description in that bug report. Then, I 
encountered a missing header file. After a long time of head-banging, I realized
I had to set up an env var to the path of Xerces' source, instead of its binary
installation. After I did it, everything worked.


<p> <p> <p>
After Pathan was installed (which took several hours all in all), I compiled
dbxml, which went very flawlessly, and nice. Did not have time to experience
with it yet, but I may need to find a way to use it from within a scripting
language of some sort, because I'm not fond of using C++ for this.


<p> <p> <p>
What I did do was play with the Perl <tt>XML::XPath</tt> CPAN module. I got
the hang of XPath through it, but of course, the queries did not run very
quickly as it's a pure Perl module.


<p> <p> <p><b>Upgrading to Mandrake 10.0</b>

<p> <p> <p>
I upgraded to Mandrake 10.0. The upgrade went pretty OK, albeit it is highly
possible the CDs were not burned well. Then came the usual slew of upgrade
problems.


<p> <p> <p>
First thing was that xmms kept crashing when trying to play a song. I found
out the problem was that xmms-arts was not installed at all, and so had to 
install it. After I did (version 0.7.0) everything worked well. 0.7.0 seems
more solid than 0.6.0 which was buggy as hell and forced me to downgrade to
0.4.0.


<p> <p> <p>
Then I realized I had no Internet. Apparently, the Ethernet driver 
configuration got lost and I had to fix it using a quick visit to the Mandrake 
Control Center.


<p> <p> <p>
Afterwards, I found out KMail was crashing and I could not read the mail. 
I had no idea why, until I looked at the rpms list and found out that version
3.1.x of KMail was still installed. I removed it and installed KMail 3.2.x 
instead. The problem was probably that kmail 3.1.x belonged to kdenetwork
and kmail 3.2.x to kdepim.


<p> <p> <p>
Then, kmail informed me that it was now using $HOME/.Mail instead of $HOME/Mail
and had to move all the directories. I instructed it to do so, but then I saw 
that it displayed none of my existing folders. I panicked ("all my mail 
was lost"), but then remembered to check ~/.Mail. What I found there was that
there was a ~/.Mail/Mail directory there, with all my original files. (stupid
KMail!!). So I moved all the files manually to ~/.Mail/ and then everything 
worked fine.


<p> <p> <p>
One thing I noticed was that suddenly all my fonts became smaller. It may
have to do with the Sans font becoming smaller, for some reason. I changed
the fonts manually in kmail. gvim itself displayed the fonts in a horrid font.
After consulting the good guys at FreeNode's #vim channel, I found out that I had to do a <tt>set guifont=Bitstream\ Vera\ Sans\ Mono\ 12</tt> (with backslashes
before ths spaces) instead of a 
<tt>set guifont="Bitstream Vera Sans Mono 12"</tt> (surrounded by
double quotation marks) which worked fine previously. Don't ask me why, but 
it works.


<p> <p> <p>
The came the GIMP Compilation problem. I tried to compile gimp from cvs, but
could not because of the following error: &lt;&lt; Can't locate object method 
"path" via package "Request" at /usr/share/autoconf/Autom4te/C4che.pm line 69, 
&lt;GEN1&gt; line 111. &gt;&gt;. After I searched google for it (which was a bit
hard because it does not accept quotation marks inside.), I realized that
I had to delete the <tt>autom4te.cache</tt> directory and then everything 
worked. Afterwards, during the linking stage I had to resymlink some shared
libraries because gimp was looking for their canonical unversioned filenames.


<p> <p> <p>
The last problem I encountered was that Samba did not send Hebrew filenames
to my Win98 laptop. I looked at the smb.conf man page, but could not find 
anything. So I logged on to the channel #linux.il at EF-Net, where someone told
me I needed to set the "unix charset" directive (and from my understanding the 
"dos charset" directive as well). This caused everything to work again. I also
deleted the old directives that were relevant only to Samba 2.x.


<p> <p> <p>
Just another typical upgrade, only this time more eventful.


<p> <p> <p><b>Perl Meeting</b>

<p> <p> <p>
We had <a href="http://www.perl.org.il/20040311.html">an Israeli Perl Mongers
    meeting</a> last Thursday. Here is 
<a href="http://www.perl.org.il/kwiki/index.cgi?MeetingReport2004Mar11">my 
    report of it</a> as I wrote in the Israeli Perl Mongers Wiki.


<p> <p> <p><b>Telux Meeting</b>

<p> <p> <p>
Last Sunday we had a Tel Aviv Linux Club meeting. Ohad Ben-Cohen gave a very
nice lecture about Securing Linux. I learned through it about some common 
exploits and about some ways to better secure your Linux system. (which I
am a bit reluctant to implement on my system).


<p> <p> <p>
One thing that disturbed us was that the lecture was prepared in PowerPoint
2000, instead of in a cross-platform solution like OpenOffice. Lecturers
should know better than that. And besides, the PowerPoint 2000 format has a 
security problem of containing the Ethernet address of the computer in which
it was last edited. So the shoe-maker has no shoes.


<p> <p> <p><b>GIMP Bug</b>

<p> <p> <p>
After playing a bit with the GIMP, I discovered <a href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=137147">a GIMP bug</a>. Apparently, it also exists in 
GIMP 1.2.0, and is quite annoying.


<p> <p> <p><b>Reading</b>

<p> <p> <p>
I finished reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0465067107/qid=1079463258/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/103-6327479-7074245">"The 
    Design of Everyday Things"</a> and wrote 
<a href="http://www.perl.org.il/kwiki/index.cgi?BookReviewTheDesignOfEverydayThingsByShlomif">a 
    review of it</a>. All in all it's
a very good book: very entertaining and very important.


<p> <p> <p>
Now I started reading "The qmail Handbook", which I took from the book giveaway
of the last YAPC. Having read the first chapter of the introduction, I was 
impressed with qmail's feature-set and design. The second chapter with the 
installation instructions left with the feeling that Dan Bernstein wished to
make it hard on his users. Clearly his belief that "There are two kinds of 
interfaces: good interfaces and user interfaces" is showing. As a result of it
and its license, qmail is a mess to install. But I'll read on, because I need
to administer a qmail installation and may need to administer further ones 
in the future.


<p> <p> <p><b>Studies</b>

<p> <p> <p>
I've been studying a lot lately for my upcoming Thermodynamics exam. I finally
got the hang of Ideal gas (Fermions or Bosons) in the classical limit, and 
Fermion Gas and Boson Gas in the quantum limit. With the help of someone on the
IRC, I understood something else about it which disturbed me.
