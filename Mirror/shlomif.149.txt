<p><b>YAPC</b>

<p> <p>
The <a href="http://www.perl.org.il/YAPC/2003/">first Israeli Yet Another Perl Conference</a>
took place on Sunday. I had to drive to Haifa on Saturday's afternoon. When
I wook up on Sunday, I realized that I forgot to turn on the Alarm clock, so
I only had time to shave before meeting Shlomo Yona. We drove to Haifa
University where the conference took place.


<p> <p>
I ate before the conference, only to find out that a lot of snacks were
served beforehand. I gave a lightning talk about "Meta-Data Database Access",
and other gave others ligthning talk. The lectures I attended were the
Lightning talks, Mark Jason Dominus' lecture about the Perl Quiz-of-the-week,
Reuven Lerner's presentation about 5 things every Perl programmer should know,
a talk about Designing database bound objects for web applications, "Perl
works for business systems", and "Rui - Remote User Interface" by Ran Eilam,
who was my Supervisor back when I worked in Cortext. Afterwards, I attended
the Thokbook lecture by Martha Greenberg (the only female presentor there), and
Mark Jason Dominus' Twelve Lightning talks presentation.


<p> <p>
Most of the presentations were really nice and enjoyable. At the end of the day
there was an enrollment of presents. My name came in first, and I chose a book
about SVG Programming. Every attendee also received a standard bag with some
papers about the conference, a note-book and a pen.


<p> <p>
At the end of the day, there was a talkers' dinner, and the food was good.
Afterwards, I returned home.


<p> <p><b>Haifux Lecture</b>

<p> <p>
On Monday there was a Haifux lecture by Oleg Goldshmidt about "Scaling Way
Up". He gave a presentation about building a specialized cluster of 64K
dual computation nodes. The lecture was entertaining.


<p> <p><b>Studies</b>

<p> <p>
I met with my "Intro to Software Systems" partner yesterday to sit on the
homework. We had a productive session, but he had to go in the middle. Today's
morning I sat on what was remaining: a binary search tree node deletion
function and one to search it for a node. When I ran the test program,
I received a couple of segfaults. One was because of a bug I cannot remember,
and the other one was because I did not set up the parent pointers of
some modified nodes properly in the node-delete function. Afterwards, there
was a bug that the search-for function did not set the iterator accordingly,
which was easily resolved.


<p> <p>
Today, it was scheduled to work on the Micro-computers exercise. However,
my partner could not come because the trains are inactive (due to the strike).
When the hour arrived I called him and found out he's still in Tel-Aviv. We
scheduled for tomorrow when I return home. There's a new exercise about the
Floating-Point Unit, which we'll also have to look at.


<p> <p><b>Hacktivity</b>

<p> <p>
Not too much, but still. I've been working on revamping the perl* man pages,
and sent the patches to perl5-porters. I received some commentary and then
sent new patches, to reflect it.
