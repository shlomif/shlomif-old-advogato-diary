<p><b>LWN Closing</b>

<p> <p>
It's a pity that <a href="http://www.lwn.net/">Linux Weekly News</a> is closing. I think it is one of the best Linux resources around, and I would really miss it. I still wonder why they did not try requiring subscriptions
to read their articles. I'm sure many people would have paid and they could have released old editions for everybody to link to after a fixed amount of time.

Oh well: who is John Galt?


<p> <p><b>New Site for Freecell Solver</b>

<p> <p>
I spent the better time of yesterday's afternoon working on a new site for <a href="/proj/Freecell%20Solver/">Freecell Solver</a>. I opened a new branch for it on the CVS, but I finished so quickly that I quickly merged it with HEAD, without modifying HEAD at all.


<p> <p>
You are welcome to <a href="http://vipe.technion.ac.il/~shlomif/freecell-solver/">
Check it out</a> and let me know what you think.


<p> <p>
I also played with rsync and got it to work quite quickly. I used scp before and rsync is much better.
<a href="http://developer.berlios.de/">BerliOS</a> does not seem to carry it on their server, so I had to install
it under my home directory. Afterwards, I tweaked the makefile to extract several files out of the latest stable
Freecell Solver archive and put them on the site.


<p> <p>
As a side note, I should add that a Google search for Freecell Solver now turns the 2.4.3 Freshmeat release as
the first hit, the Freshmeat record as the second, the BerliOS mirror as the third, and the real homepage as No. 4. Google seems to have such anomalies sometimes, and I hope it won't persist in its next update.


<p> <p><b>Agenda</b>

<p> <p>
Here is what I'm planning to do next:


<p> <p>
<ol>
<li>Work on the university project
<li>Review the Autotools lecture in preparation for giving it
<li>Prepare a lecture about WebMetaLanguage
<li>RPM-Spec enable <a href="/proj/LM-Solve/">LM-Solve</a>
</ol>
