<p><b>mod_php using Qmail</b>

<p> <p>
I encountered some problems on iglu.org.il with PostNuke. Apparently, I could
not send mail. After I upgraded php to the latest version, I discovered that
I could send mail from the command line, but not from mod_php. By "tail -f"-ing
the web-server's log, I found out an error: "<tt>qmail-inject: fatal: read error</tt>". I searched for it and eventually found <a href="http://msgs.securepoint.com/cgi-bin/get/qmail0202/322/2/1.html">a post that says how to resolve it</a>.


<p> <p>
Worked like a charm.


<p> <p><b>Biking</b>

<p> <p>
I tried to fill air in my bicycle's wheel, and it worked. Hallelujah! Now,
I've already went biking twice, and it's good to be back in the habit. I hope
that's the end of the phantom problems with it.


<p> <p><b>Hacktivity</b>

<p> <p>
This and that. I've been trying to find some Subversion bugs to resolve, and
so far have been only bugging with it the Subversion development list. I also
wrote a Perl script to submit a site to <a href="http://dmoz.org/">dmoz</a>,
seeing how my browser gets stuck doing that. The script seems to submit 
everything, but the site does not arrive at dmoz (checked it with my own
category). Then I discovered there is a better way for me as an editor 
to submit sites.
