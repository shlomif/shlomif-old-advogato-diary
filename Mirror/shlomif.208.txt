<p><b>Passover Seder</b>

<p> <p>
My extended family held a Passover Seder last Monday. It was very nice, and
it featured that in the second part of it my cousin Ronen and his wife came to 
visit. (he and his wife are now staying in Seatlle where he works). He said
that his work demands long hours, and he works in a company that does all
kinds of things with computer games.


<p> <p><b>Hike with Dad</b>

<p> <p>
My father and I decided to go outdoors at one day of the Passover vacation.
We drove all the way to the Apolonia site in Hertzlia, and nearly lost our way
there, only to find out it got closed shortly afterwards. So we drove back
home and this time really lost our way (there were no signs there), but managed
to get back home. We went to the field north of the neighbourhood. There were
many blooming flowers there ("Kahvanim" and "Hartzioth" and others which I
did not know by name). We also noticed the horses farm that was established 
there. One time I've been there a horse nearly ran over me, which made me 
unwilling to return. We also visited the Shomronite graves there. So, it was
very nice.


<p> <p><b>Perl Meeting</b>

<p> <p>
We held a Perl meeting at April 1st. I wrote <a href="http://www.perl.org.il/kwiki/index.cgi?MeetingReport2004Apr01">a 
    report of it</a> on the Perl Mongers Wiki.


<p> <p><b>Registering to Yahoo Messenger</b>

<p> <p>
The guy I teach Perl too, only has a Yahoo Messenger and MSN Messenger 
accounts for IM. So I had to get an account on one of these. I tried to do
so for both, but with no avail. Eventually I succeeded in making Yahoo work.
The steps I took were:


<p> <p>
1. Vainly trying to configure it in gaim.<br/>
2. Reading the Gaim FAQ, and realizing that I need a newer 
version of Gaim.<br/>
3. Downloading the SRPM of the new version of Gaim.<br/>
4. Trying to install the depedencies, and discovering that they were moved 
to a different place.<br/>
5. Reconfiguring the Mandrake sources (which made it download the hdlist.cz 
all over again.)<br/>
6. Downloading the dependencies.<br/>
7. Compiling the SRPM.<br />
8. Installing the RPM.<br />
9. Successfully loginning in to Yahoo Messenger!.<br />


<p> <p>
Now allow me to faint...


<p> <p><b>RMS-Lint</b>

<p> <p>
My <a href="http://www.iglu.org.il/IGLU/modules.php?op=modload&name=News&file=article&sid=33&mode=thread&order=0&thold=0">RMS-Lint article</a> that I
published on 1 April, <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/04/01/1344214&mode=thread&tid=117&tid=99">got slashdotted</a> after I submitted it there.
This caused the iglu.org.il server to become unresponsive. At first to every
protocol, but after a day or so, only to HTTP. (ssh was fine). After a fellow
administrator restarted the web-server, everything worked fine again.


<p> <p>
I guess I shouldn't try to slashdot an Israeli resource like that again.


<p> <p><b>Reading</b>

<p> <p>
I finished reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1893115402/qid=1081681896/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/104-6592268-6688741">"The qmail 
    Handbook"</a> and wrote <a href="http://www.perl.org.il/kwiki/index.cgi?BookReviewTheQmailHandbookByShlomif">a 
    review of it</a> to the Israel.PM Wiki. It seems like I was given
the first edition while there's already a second one. 

<p>
Now I started reading the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0618057072/qid=1081682165/sr=1-2/ref=sr_1_2/104-6592268-6688741">"The
    Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicamarel Mind"
    by Julian Jaynes</a>, a book I have wanted to read for a long time. 


<p> <p>
I'm now at half of the book, and it's very interesting so far. Mind blowing,
even.


<p> <p><b>iglu.org.il</b>

<p> <p>
I was finally able to enable unregistered users to submit news in 
www.iglu.org.il. This had been a factor that decreased the site's popularity
in the past after the switch from the Zope and Squishdot framework which 
allowed that. Now, there's a minor problem that no topics appear in the
topics drop-down, but I haven't figured out how to enable this. Still, it's
still functional.


<p> <p><b>Hacktivity</b>

<p> <p>
Not too much. In Subversion, I started tackling an efficient tracing of the 
past revision URL from a peg URL and revision. I got halted in the middle
because I did not know how to design the appropriate protocol over Subversion's
variant of WebDAV/DeltaV. After a lot of reading and consultation, I was
able to deduce something on my own, but afterwards C. Michael Pilato gave a 
specification for a different API handler that he'd like to see implemented.


<p> <p>
So, now I'm on the rebound waiting for some Subversion officials to what 
exactly should be done.


<p> <p>
Otherwise, I spent some time yesterday, cleaning up my Dmoz.org categories. It
was time consuming, but now I have very few pending links there.


<p> <p><b>Google and the Google Directory</b>

<p> <p>
Google seemed to have lowered the profile of the Google directory. For once,
it isn't linked to from <a href="http://www.google.com/">the front page</a>,
or from a search results page. The web-sites that are searched now also 
don't contain the directory's description or links to the category where
it appears in.


<p> <p>
It does appear in the <a href="http://www.google.com/options/">More Google
    options page</a>, but this is relatively out of the way. This is a step
backwards because I actually liked the descriptions and the integration
with the directory. Besides that, the Directory is still heavily out
of date, and was not synchronized with dmoz.org in a long while.
