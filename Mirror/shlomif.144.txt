<p><b>Studies</b>

<p> <p>
Technion studies have began. I'm taking four courses this semester. Three
of them were taken out of understanding that they would probably be easy to me
and the other one (Micro-computers) interested me, and was also taken by a 
fellow Haifuxer. So far, I have quite a lot of homework assignments, but I
still have a lot of free time. (maybe too much for my own good). I no longer
have the Com-Net workstation due to the fact I no longer study there, and 
could not get a work there. This leaves me with the Technion facilities, which
are inadequate for my needs at best. :-(


<p> <p><b>Perl Golf</b>

<p> <p>
I've been playing quite a lot of <a href="http://terje.perlgolf.org/">Perl 
    Mini Golf</a> lately. Perl Golf is a contest in which the participants 
try to write the shortest (character-wise) Perl program to achieve a certain
end. This creates highly compressed and obfuscated programs, with some very
unorthodox tricks, and lack of attention to conventions.


<p> <p>
Perl Golfing is an addiction in which I routinely use gvim to edit two lines,
trying to make the second one shorter than the original. I also tend to
scan the core perl man pages a lot looking for clues on how to make it shorter.
So far, I've been doing relatively well, but there always seem to be some
people who can find better (or slightly better) solutions, and it's a bit
frustrating. Oh well.


<p> <p>
I usually read the winning entry or entries and try to understand 
them. This has made me relatively fluent in reading Perl Golf 
code, which is quite amazing because these things look like
absolute line noise. I wonder if some people can fluently understand vi macros... ;-)


<p> <p><b>IRCing</b>

<p> <p>
I spent most of yesterday hanging on the IRC. (despite the fact that I have
a Micro-Computers exercise that I'd like to prepare by myself this weekend). 
I was able to help an Apache newbie (who actually uses Slackware and knows
his way around Linux), with the Alias and ScriptAlias directives. I also
discussed E-mail MTAs with a couple of people on the Perl channel. Then
there was naturally, #offtopic on irc.kernelnewbies.org, in which topics
ranged from the latest <a href="http://www.tpc.org/">TPC-C</a> results
for 32-way Itanium 2 machines running Windows 2003, to SMP machines in general,
to the history of ancient Europe, to Linguistics. In short: Life, the Universe
and Everything. Off-topic indeed.


<p> <p><b>Certification</b>

<p> <p>
I certified <a href="/person/wli/">wli</a> as Journeyer, because of his work on the
Linux kernel, and his vast knowledge. (I also taken into account the fact
he writes his scripts in Haskell). He is already certified as a Master, 
but I'll have to know him better than my superficial familiarity with
him to do so.


<p> <p><b>Hacktivity</b>

<p> <p>
Not much to show for, unfortunately, but quite a lot of small, relatively
useless stuff. Been working on my Haifux Lectures Manager a bit. And then
I wrote google.pl, a CGI (or mod_perl and friends) Perl script that acts
as a mirror for Google. (I did not release it yet). I also made a coverage
of the bugzilla bugs I reported, and found out most of them could be
overcome or have been resolved. Kudos to the Mozilla team for the great 
work. 


<p> <p>
Per request of my Debian package maintainer, I updated the Freecell Solver 
config.guess and config.sub files to the latest avaialable from the 
<a href="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/config/">GNU site</a>. It took me quite 
some time to find out how to get them properly, and someone on the 
Autoconf mailing list helped with that. It is strange that libtool 1.4.3
which is quite recent does not contain them, but rather very old ones. Who
can tell the ways of the GNU?


<p> <p><b>Some Thoughts about UNIX TCO</b>

<p> <p>
A recent Slashdot feature pointed to an Enlightening article about the TCO
of a system with one central server and several X terminals. I've seen this
X terminals, which can only be used to connect to a server over the network,
and realize they require almost zero maintenance in comparison to 
full-fledged workstations. As far as a university is concerned, by using a 
server, one can install things in only one computer and allow everyone else
to enjoy it, while a corresponding client-server architecture, would require
installing packages on several different workstations somehow. 


<p> <p>
Now in a workplace where everybody administers his own workstation, the second
option may actually make sense. But a university has farms with unpriviliged
access. In the Technion we have many farms with such client-server 
configurations, and the software installed on it, is inadequate for the needs
of many (if not all) students. And naturally, it is impossible to install
new one, because it requires a system-wide installation. Strangely enough,
there are also UNIX farms with a multiple workstation configuration, that
suffer from similar symptoms as well. This X-terminals configuration sounds
like a solution with a TCO from paradise, and it's interesting that the
Technion did not deploy it widely.
