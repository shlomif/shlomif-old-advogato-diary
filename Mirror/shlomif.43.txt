I finally have an <a href="http://lm-solve.bkbits.net/">on-line BK  
repository</a>. It took me quite some time to get the ropes, but I  
think I now know how to use the basic system. It is more tedious to  
work with than CVS is, but I suppose such power has to come at some  
cost.

I'll probably check Arch and Subversion sometime later, just to get  
an objective review of what they give me.
