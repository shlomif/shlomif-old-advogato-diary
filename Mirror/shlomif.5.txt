Roy (my partner for the IP-Noise project) and I met with 
the project's 
supervisor on Wednesday. The meeting went very well, and I 
managed 
to get some input from him on several things I needed to 
be clarified. 
He said he was quite content with our progress so far, and 
that we may
have to prepare the dummy midterm presentation soon.

I opened a project for IP-Noise on BerliOS, mainly for 
being able to use
CVS. I imported several useless directory trees into the 
CVS, but I now
think I got the hang of it. I also set up several things 
at our local
box (including a CVS server), and now everything behaves 
like I want it
to.

I'll probably do some work on the R2L applet this weekend, 
as well as on 
the perl lecture. Unfortunately, vipe is not accessible 
due to a Technion 
network problem, so I don't have access to my TODO list. I 
think I'll send
it to other systems from now on (or will keep it on 
iglu.org.il).
