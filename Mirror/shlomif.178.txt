<p><b>Google Mirroring Script</b>

<p> <p>
I wrote a 
<a href="http://fc-solve.berlios.de/google/">Perl Script that mirrors the www.google.com domain</a>. (and with some customization, other domains as well). The incenetive
is to set up as many mirrors of Google worldwide as possible in order to battle's the Great Firewall of China's blocking of this useful resource, and to give
the people (of the People's Republic of China) what
they want.

There's <a href="http://www.iglu.org.il/shlomif/google.cgi/en">a demonstration of it</a> but it's a slow link and works only with lynx, because of Google's user-agent idiosyncracies.
