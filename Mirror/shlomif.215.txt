<p><b>RTFM vs. JATFM</b>

<p> <p>
I recently had to figure out how to do something with wget: get everything
below a directory on the web-server, without following links to outside it.
So I logged in to FreeNode's <tt>#debian</tt> channel, where there are many
knowledgable people to ask it. The first answer I got was "RTFM". So, I read
the wget man page, but could not find it there. Eventually, after telling
people that it would be faster to give an answer, I got a reply (
add the <tt>-np -r</tt> flags). But this has been the last straw.


<p> <p>
I composed my own acronym. Just like RTFM is "Read the Fabulous Manual"
and STFW is "Search the Fabulous Web", then JATFM is "Just Answer the
Fabulous Man". It means that it's usually faster to answer someone's question
than to ask him to RTFM, which is just going to annoy him. I think the RTFM
mantra has done a lot of damage in the UNIX/Linux world, and I hope JATFMing
would prove to be a more healthy ideology.


<p> <p><b>Linux T-Shirt Giveaway</b>

<p> <p>
One day when I was just returning from my walk, a guy approached me and
asked me about my Linux T-shirt, in English. It turned out he was using
Linux and FreeBSD, and was interested in such T-Shirts. He was working as
a Journalist in an Israeli newspaper, and was using Windows in his workplace.

<p>
I invited him to come to my house, and when he did gave him one of my shirts.
At first, I thought he was a Medium, but it turned out the Large T-shirt was
OK for him. He took off his shirt, and wore the Linux one instead. He gave me
his old shirt for me to throw away.

<p>
We then went to the computer and exchanged contact information. He called
me some hours later, but I was busy, but I think I'll call him back on my own.


<p> <p><b>Jewish Holidays</b>

<p> <p>
Now is the Jewish Holiday Season. First of all - Shana Tova (= Happy New
Year) to all Jews and non-Jews. Yom Kippur also came along, so "Gmar Hatima
Tova" ("A Good Signing") to all. And finally, Happy Sukoth.

<p>
In Israel, many secular Jewish families hold a family dinner on Rosh Hashana.
In the States, it seems Jews just go to the synagogue.


<p> <p><b>Open Letter to the California Governor</b>

<p> <p>
I wrote <a href="http://trends.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=04/09/08/1423240&amp;tid=136&amp;tid=1">an
    open-letter to the California Governor regarding the recent report about
    cutting the California State spending.</a>. It is a bit redundant and
the comments there are even more so. Still, I hope the appropriate forces in
the California Government will take it to heart. An anecdote about it is
that I originally wrote it on paper.


<p> <p><b>Links of Interest</b>

<p> <p>
<a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/tddpirate/13614.html">Read this
    entry in Omer Zak's Journal</a> (to which I have responded) for something
that Omer said about being unwilling to help people who aren't using Debian,
and why I proved it was a bad attitude. (it all leads to the ancient and
mind-destroying "I'm not getting paid to do open-source work, so my users
need to play by my rules" mantra).


<p> <p>
There's
<a href="http://interviews.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/09/14/1347226">a
    very interesting interview with Real Networks' CEO on Slashdot</a>. A
highly recommended read. Trying the Real Player 10 for Linux I was very
disappointed, though: it's not a drag and drop target, had a very crappy
file opening dialog and it could not play mp3's.

<p>
There's also a <a href="http://interviews.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/09/20/1423219">very interesting interview</a> with the U.S. Libertarian Party
Candidate. I sure do hope Libertarians take the next elections, and will also
add a button to my homepage about it.


<p> <p><b>Freenode's beth is engaged!</b>

<p> <p>
<a href="http://loxosceles.org/">Beth Skwarecki</a> (a.k.a. "beth" on Freenode)
<a href="http://loxosceles.org/scripts/date.pl?d=2004-09-13_We_re_getting_married">has
    become engaged to her long-time boyfriend now</a>. Congratulations!


<p> <p>
It's funny that many people I know my age are already married. Plus, my cousin
who's my age already has a baby now. Roy Glasberg, too. And
<a href="http://www.benschmaus.com/">Ben Schmaus</a> already managed to
become separated from his wife. And I did not have a girlfriend, yet. Oh well.


<p> <p><b>Yom Kippur Activity</b>

<p> <p>
In Yom Kippur the Jews believe that God measures a person's balance of good
and bad deeds and thus determines if he is worthy of living for another year.
I am pretty sure, that the values I produced in the recent year (i.e: my good
deeds), exceed the values I consumed (i.e: my bad deeds). Nevertheless, I
have decided to go over the blog entries I wrote in the past year and see
what I did well, what I did wrong, and what I can improve.


<p> <p>
First of all, I'd like to say that I was dazzled by all the productive
things I did. I certainly can congratulate myself on that. A trend in the
past year was for me to also contribute to large-scale, non-individualistic
projects like Subversion or GIMP, and I hope to continue in it. My biggest
mistake in the past year was
<a href="http://advogato.org/person/shlomif/diary.html?start=203">the
    post to the Joel on Software forum about my Technion Grades</a>.
I'll know better than that next time.


<p> <p><b>Article Writing</b>

<p> <p>
I wrote a new version of an old article, and sent it to a few selected
reviewers. As a result, I received three (!) messages saying they are no
longer interested in receiving such articles. I was a bit distressed, but
then I understood that I should send the articles to people who volunteered
to do so, at first. That's what I did. I <a href="http://www.whatsup.org.il/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=3559">posted
    a notice about it in Whatsup</a> and received several E-mails from people
who were interested. (some of the comments simply attacked me, but that is
besides the point).


<p> <p>
So now I'm sending them messages. So far, I did not receive any reply, but
at least I'm not walking on people's toes.


<p> <p><b>Events</b>

<p> <p>
There was a Telux meeting where I gave a lecture about Freecell Solver. There
were only two people who attended it besides me, but it was still a lot of
fun, and people said it was very interesting.


<p> <p>
There was also a TAU-Sec meeting. This time they also bought
drinks and refreshments. The first presentation about Intrusion Detection
tools was very interesting. In the second one, the speaker was heavily
non-fluent, probably because of excitement, so I left early. But there was
heavy attendance.


<p> <p><b>Work on the Home-Site</b>

<p> <p>
I've done a lot of work on <a href="http://shlomif.il.eu.org/">my
    home-site</a> lately. Reading from the news I posted about it:


<p> <ol>
<li>
I added the <a href="http://swpat.ffii.org/">"Stop Software Patents!"</a> nag
image to all my pages and a top frame to the front page.

<li>
There's a new code for the navigation menu. The old code was an unholy mess,
and the new code is a pure Perl one, which makes the nav-menu much easier
to maintain.

<li>
Thanks to the new navigation menu code, there are now Mozilla/Firefox
navigation links, that allow traversing the site page by page. For those who
are unfortunate enough not to use these browsers, some rudimentary arrows were
added above the navigation menu.

<li>
I now have an Uber-kitchy leading path of the page sections and sub-sections at
the top.

<li>
I'm now <a href="./work/private-lessons/">giving private lessons</a> in
high-school subjects and computer-related topics.

</ol>

<p> <p>
Later on, I added more pages. Things I still need to do are:


<p> <ol>
    <li>
    Add Alt+P, Alt+N, Alt+U key-bindings to traverse the site.

    <li>
    Add a nice news items summary news box at the top with the site
    news. Also create an RSS feed for them.

    <li>
    Create a site-map page.

</ol>

<p> <p>
Enjoy!


<p> <p><b>Upgrade to Mandrake 10.1 Community Edition</b>

<p> <p>
I downloaded the Mandrake 10.1 CE CDs, and placed all the RPMs in one
directory. That's because I did not know where I can find a network
repository. Then, I created a urpmi media for them. Afterwards I ran
the command <tt>urpmi --auto-select --auto</tt> overnight. This eventually
caused the computer to become unresponsive. (I still blame the Britney Spears
wallpaper I placed on IceWM, when I did the installation for that.)


<p> <p>
After a reboot, I initiated the command again, this time with a different
girl on the desktop. This time it's worked. I rebooted again to use the new
kernel, and everything was OK. 10.1 CE is more polished than 10.0 and has
fewer bugs. (albeit there are a few new minor ones). I'm very happy with it.


<p> <p>
For the occasion of the upgrade, I changed all the wallpapers of the
virtual workspaces. Desktop 1 now has a picture of Jaime Pressly. Desktop
2 now has a photograph of a squirrel that <a href="/person/ladypine/">ladypine</a> took
in her last OLS trip. Desktop 3 has a picture of Beth (see above). Desktop
4 has a 3-D model of a tree with a reflection in the lake, out of the Book
of Beginnings. Desktop 5 still carries the picture of Melissa Joan Hart with
the background of automn leaves. Desktop 6 has a picture of a Chinese girl
from a computer game (found in <a href="http://www.unforgottenrealms.net/wallpapers_misc.php">the Unforgotten Realms Wallpapers</a>). Desktop 7 has a photo
of Kate Beckinsale. And Desktop 8 has a picture of Charisma Carpenter covered
in the American Flag.
