<p> <p> <p><b>Slashdot Commenting</b>

<p> <p> <p>
It happened! I posted a few comments to Slashdot. Here's
<a href="http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=117863&amp;cid=9962843">one
    that is a joke reply to another joke that was posted</a>. It was too
late for it to be rated highly.
<a href="http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=118112&amp;cid=9982132">Another</a>
is a question to ask Sam Greenblatt about Ingres. The latter was rated 5 and
marked as Interesting.


<p> <p> <p>
<a href="/person/kilmo/">kilmo</a>, I think I'll join your support group. "Hello, my name
is Shlomi and I posted a comment to Slashdot that was rated 5 and marked as
Interesting."; "Hello Shlomi! We all love you!".


<p> <p> <p><b>RSS Aggregator</b>

<p> <p> <p>
I installed akregator for KDE. The installation went very well, and I installed
from source and could not find an RPM. I now got used to it, and can no longer
imagine living without it. (periodically visiting web-sites - how barbaric!)


<p> <p> <p><b>Karma Games at FreeNode's #perl</b>

<p> <p> <p>
<a href="http://shlomif.il.eu.org/irc/logs/FreeNode-%23perl-karma-games.log">This
    is a log of FreeNode's #perl channel with some heavy karma games</a>.
Namely I asked Chris62vw (perlbot's maintainer) for a feature which displays
the top (or bottom) karmas, and he decided to implement it on the spot. And
there was a lot of other silly discussion.


<p> <p> <p><b>Hackers-IL MediaWiki</b>

<p> <p> <p>
I set up a <a href="http://www.hackers.org.il/mediawiki/index.php/Main_Page">
    MediaWiki for Hackers-IL</a>. It was surprisingly easy to set up, and
worked very nicely so far. Then, I created <a href="http://www.hackers.org.il/mediawiki/index.php/Our_Logo">an Emblem for Hackers-IL</a> based on the Hackers
Emblem by ESR, and the Israeli Flag.


<p> <p> <p>
I filled the wiki with a lot of content, and other people have created pages
there of their own. It now also proves useful for coordination of W2L.


<p> <p> <p>
I wanted to use the Creative Commons Attribution-Only License for it. But it
seems more people would like to use the ShareAlike one which is good too.


<p> <p> <p><b>Events</b>

<p> <p> <p>
There was a Telux meeting about bootloaders by Ori Idan. He used PerlPoint for
the first time for this lecture and prepared it in a haste, so he had a few
glitches which I took record of some of them in my notebook. (and sent it to
him after the lecture). The lecture was under-advertised and so we were only
five people there. I think it would be a good idea for Ori to give it at a
later date.


<p> <p> <p>
Still, the lecture was very interesting, and some things raised some
discussions. Ori is a good lecturer.


<p> <p> <p>
There was also <a href="http://www.perl.org.il/20040819.html">an
    Israeli Perl Mongers meeting</a> which was very nice. There's a report
about it in the link.


<p> <p> <p><b>Books' Exchange with Talash</b>

<p> <p> <p>
<a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/talash/">Michael
    Perelmutter ("Talash")</a> is a really nice guy, who attended the
TAU-Sec lectures and escorted me on the way back home as he lives nearby.
While talking on IM, we decided to exchange books. So he dropped by my
house and gave me two Discworld books. He and I went over the house looking
for good books he did not read already. (He already read Sherlock Holmes,
the writings of Lewis Carroll, Jules Verne, and lots of other things I had to
offer.) He eventually took the following books:

<p> <ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0809058405/qid=1093086648/sr=ka-1/ref=pd_ka_1/002-1619547-2408035">Innumeracy by John Allen Paulos</a>

    <li>
    <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0226650251/qid=1093086698/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/002-1619547-2408035">Mathematics and Humor</a> (by the
    same author.

    <li>
    <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0553377884/qid=1093086925/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/002-1619547-2408035">Skinny Legs and All by Tom
        Robbins</a>

    <li>
    He also took the Monkey Island 3 CDs so he can make a copy of, return
    them to me and play it. (I have already played it.)

</ul>
<p>
All in all, it's nice to meet such new people.


<p> <p> <p><b>New Story</b>

<p> <p> <p>
Ssssshhh! Don't tell anyone, but I'm writing a new story. Surprisingly, I
got the idea for the entire plot almost at once, and lately have been
cutting some lose edges in my idea. (extraneous characters, etc.) The story
is written in English, and focuses on high-school teenagers at present Los
Angeles, California.

<p> <p>
It talks about one female open-source hacker who is a full guru, but a
self-made social outcast, and a punk, who tutors a female hacker wannabe,
(who is also the narrator of the story) who is a pop-culture and very solid
girl, who's at first only interested in open-source so she can get to a good
college. There are then other twists to the plot.

<p> <p>
Hopefully, I'll finish the story in time for the Free Software Day, but I
cannot promise anything. If you'd like to receive drafts of this story by
E-mail, <a href="mailto:shlomif@iglu.org.il">let me know</a> and I'll put
you in my distribution list.
