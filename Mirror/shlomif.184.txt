<p><b>Studies</b>

<p> <p>
My first week started quite eventfully. After the day in which I had
Thermodynamics, which went OK and in which I learned little new things, I 
went expectedly to the "Automata and Formal Languages" lecture. There, I 
discovered that "Set Theory and Logic" is a hard pre-requisite for the 
course. I talked with the lecturer during the break and he told me that he
won't allow me to take the course. I asked him why the requisite was so
important and he said that "You see, we have set theory all over the place". 
But I did not have a problem to understand what I saw in the first half of
the lesson!


<p> <p>
In any case, I cancelled the registration for this course and registered to
a different course from the Electrical Engineering Department on the same
day. ("Design of High-Speed Digital Systems") For it I'm sure I have the
pre-requisites.


<p> <p><b>DVD Playing Trouble</b>

<p> <p>
I had a trouble playing DVDs. Ogle and mplayer have emitted the
error ""Can't open file VIDEO_TS.IFO" and Google could not help me. I then
tried playing a music CD, and mounting a filesystem, and neither of them
worked. Then it hit me: the ide-scsi emulation! After I switched the
device to <tt>/dev/scd0</tt> (the SCSI device) everything worked fine
again.


<p> <p>
Am I lame or what?


<p> <p><b>Translation</b>

<p> <p>
I done a little translation of Homesteading the Noosphere, up to and including
the end-note about the Fijian Village Chiefs. I also received some corrections 
about "Rub a dub-dub" which I happily applied.


<p> <p><b>Subversion and Win32 Guide</b>

<p> <p>
I received an E-mail from the guy from whom the guide was intended, telling
me he failed to install Subversion once again. This time, he did do a step
he did not do before, but he did not follow the guide exactly (and named a 
URL differently), so this may be a problem. He said he'll try again later,
but meanwhile will use CVSNT for the current project. 


<p> <p><b>grip woos</b>

<p> <p>
grip ripped at 4x speed, while my CD-ROM drive is 52x max. I posted
<a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/linux-il@cs.huji.ac.il/msg30424.html">a 
    message</a> to Linux-IL about it and Matan Ziv-Av replied with a good
advice, that increased the speed to 10x. Still not maximum but better.


<p> <p><b>Welcome to Linux</b>

<p> <p>
I ended up preparing the slides for 3 out of 6 of the lectures that would be 
given in the Welcome to Linux series. Recently I was asked to prepare a
version of them that would be viewable from the hard-disk. A quick script
did the job, but it took me some time to debug it.


<p> <p>
The first lecture was given yesterday by Ori Idan. The lecturing hall was
full, many questions were asked, and Ori gave a good presentation. There
were a few glitches in the lecture that KDE there got stuck, and so
the lecture came out longer than agreed on. I came to the lecture with Ori, 
and went back with a guy who had to drive to Northern Tel Aviv, which was very 
convenient for me. He was a Linux newbie, and I told him a lot about what
I'm doing right now, about CVS, about software patents and other things.


<p> <p><b>Perl Golf</b>

<p> <p>
The last three days I was heavily occupied with <a href="http://terje2.perlgolf.org/~pgas/score.pl?func=rules&hole=46&season=1">the PERT/Gantt chart conversion
    Perl Golf</a>. The day before yesterday, I ended up with a 65-characters
long solution, and yesterday I was able to optimize it twice, each time by one 
character. Right now, I'm stuck 6 characters before the currently best 
solutions, with no ideas on how to further optimize it. But I'm still not 
giving up.
