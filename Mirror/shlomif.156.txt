<p><b>Studies</b>

<p> <p>
I had the test of Financial Management yesterday. I did not understand the 
first part at first so I decided to move to the second part, which was easier.
Then I returned to the first part and this time understood it and was able
to solve most of it. Now I have some vacation until the next test on July 14.


<p> <p>
The registration for the Winter semester is today, and I hope I can make
a convenient schedule with Thermodynamics and another subject. I'd like not
to have an apartment near the Technion next semester, so I need good times.


<p> <p><b>Knoppix</b>

<p> <p>
Someone testified on GNUbies-IL that he could not run a Knoppix CD he
burned. To see if it happens for me, I downloaded and burned the Knoppix
CD. I ran it on my computer, and it ran perfectly fine. I was impressed
from it a great deal. I was able to use KDE, surf the Internet, see Java
applets, and listen to mp3s. Very impressive.


<p> <p>
Now it seems either his CD was not burned correctly, or there's something
wrong with his computer. I'll check that out in the coming days.


<p> <p><b>Hacktivity</b>

<p> <p>
I fixed the style on my Dmoz categories. When I had tried to apply to a new
category, I was notified that the style on some of the entries did not
correspond to the dmoz guidelines. So I tried to remedy it.


<p> <p>
Other than that, I worked a bit on Quad-Pres, and added multiple themes
functionality to it.


<p> <p><b>Reading</b>

<p> <p>
I finished the chapter about SVG animations in "SVG Programming" and am now
in the beginning of "Integrating SVG with HTML".
