<p><b>Hacktivity</b>

<p> <p>
Yesterday, I started the morning with giving some final touches to the 
lectures' management code, and adding an extra future lecture. Then I went on
to handle the Syscalltrack homepage, converting everything to table based 
layout, and handling the various issues <a href="/person/ladypine/">ladypine</a> had with
it. It took me sometime to understand where things went wrong, but I was
finally able to.


<p> <p>
Finally, I did some work on Quad-Pres. I encountered a <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/linux-il@cs.huji.ac.il/msg24052.html">Permissions conflict</a>,
where I wanted files to be created with a certain group, so they can be
handled by both the user and the httpd-ran process. Two kind Linux-ILers 
answered to me how I can do that (with two different methods), and one method
I tried worked so far. (using a <tt>chgrp</tt>-like system call). The 
<a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/linux-il@cs.huji.ac.il/msg24054.html">other 
    method</a> seems even nicer, and I'll have to check if it works.


<p> <p><b>Reading</b>

<p> <p>
I finished the chapter about Objects in "Programming Perl". Then, I went on
and finished the one about Operator Overloading. That's it, I think.


<p> <p><b>Life</b>

<p> <p>
There was a strong wind and some raining yesterday, so I could not go out 
biking again. I stayed at home most of the time, either reading or working
on the computer. At the evening, I watched "Whose Line is it Anyways?",
"Just Shoot Me" and "Third Rock from the Sun", which are given on Friday
nights.
