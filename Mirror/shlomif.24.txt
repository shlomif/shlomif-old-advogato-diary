<p><b>"Rindolf" - a New Language is Born</b>

<p> <p>
I decided to start my own dialect of Perl, which I call
Rindolf. It will be based mostly on Perl 5, with some ideas
from other languages I'm familiar with and with some ideas
for cleanups I have in mind.


<p> <p>
The idea came to me after I heard <a href="/person/mulix/">mulix</a> say
that he reads the Apocalypses and Exegesis, but doesn't
understand them. It made me realize that I also felt that
most of the suggestions were either incomprehensible, or
useless for me.


<p> <p>
I plan to simply formulate a complete SPEC of the way in
which Rindolf deviates from Perl 5. That way, my
recommendation can be integrated into Perl 5, Perl 6 or
stand on their own.
