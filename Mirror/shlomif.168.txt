<p><b>Perl Meeting</b>

<p> <p>
Here's <a href="http://perl.org.il/pipermail/perl/2003-August/002851.html">a report I wrote</a> on the latest Israeli Perl Mongers, that took place on 
Thursday. My father drove me to the meeting, and at first I bought some Burekas
in the nearby bakery. Then was the meeting. After the meeting Ronen Kfir drove
me and Kfir Lavy home. Kfir and I chatted for a long time and ate supper
at McDonalds. We discussed Linux and touched on many topics, including my
projects.


<p> <p><b>Python Bindings</b>

<p> <p>
I've been toying up with the idea of integrating Freecell Solver into PySol. 
Since Freecell Solver is written in C, and PySol is a Python program, I had
to create bindings for it. At first I started using SWIG. This created very
C'ish APIs without much trace of a native language behaviour. Then I 
realized it does not handle arrays well. So I set out
to write Python in the native bindings language. I consulted the Python 
tutorial, the Python extensions writing manual, and the people at the #python 
channel on FreeNode and eventually got things to work nicely enough.


<p> <p>
I'm still a bit worried about memory leaks, but I suppose that Valgrind will 
help me detect if they exist.


<p> <p><b>Subversion Issue #1473</b>

<p> <p>
To further test my Repos-&gt;WC file copy code, I wrote a test that set up
the svn:keywords property on the source file and then copied it. The result
was nothing less than a segfault. So I <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=1473">filed an issue about it</a>. The problem is that
the translation is done without an entry existing in the .svn/entries file.


<p> <p>
Ben Collins-Sussman and I discussed the best way to resolve it on IRC. 
Our conclusion was that we should probably create another post-process routine
that will do the translation after the entry is created (which is already the
case, just that the translation is done beforehand). However, Ben thought
it was inelegant and so he wanted to consult the list.


<p> <p><b>Reading</b>

<p> <p>
I made some progress with "The Art of UNIX Programming". I also took the
book "Apache : The Definitive Guide" from the Perl Mongers book pool and
started reading it. I reached the beginning of the chapter on authentication.


<p> <p><b>Biking</b>

<p> <p>
Two days ago, when I biked, I noticed 1/3 of the way that a lot of air went
out from the back wheel. So, I returned. I don't know what causes it,
but I'll have to investigate, because I can't bike otherwise.
