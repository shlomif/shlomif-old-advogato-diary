<p><b>Hacktivity</b>

<p> <p>
This and that. I've organized my <a href="http://t2.technion.ac.il/~shlomif/svn-patches/">Subversion patches directory</a> to
exclude patches that were already applied. That way, the other maintainers
can best know what needs to be applied. I've been looking for other Subversion
issues to work on, and found some candidates, but so far did not find the
time to work on it.


<p> <p>
I also made progress in translating "Homesteading the Noosphere". A couple
of people contacted me with corrections to it, and I'm grateful for them.
Then, I made the data for my version of the Haifux lectures manager
up-to-date with recent lectures.


<p> <p>
Finally I edited the <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeCell">Wikipedia
   entry of Freecell</a> to make it less lame and more accurate than it was. I
   actually woke up in the morning thinking about Wikipedia and whether it
   mentions Freecell, checked it a bit afterwards, and in the evening changed
   it. ;-)


<p> <p><b>Reading</b>

<p> <p>
I read part of the book about Statistical Physics and Thermodynamics I have
(I'm studying Thermo next semester). I also read the first two chapters
of "The House of Arden", after being reluctant to read it for a while.


<p> <p><b>Free Software "Monopolies"</b>

<p> <p>
<a href="/person/jlouis/">jlouis</a>, I don't really see free software "monopolies" as
a bad thing. It takes a lot of time and effort to create quality software,
and so it make sense one or a few packages will rise above the rest, and
concentrate most of the effort around them. If we take gcc, for example,
then everybody use it because it's a great and trustworthy compiler.


<p> <p>
I don't see much point in switching to using anything else, just to make
an anti-monopolistic point. If gcc works, I am sticking with it. If something
better ever comes along, I might switch, but there isn't anything better
now. If you ask me, you'd better hack on gcc and make it an even better
compiler than it is now, then try to make a half-decent competition.


<p> <p><b>Certification</b>

<p> <p>
Certified <a href="/person/jlouis/">jlouis</a> as Apprentice because of the above and
other stuff I found on his homepage.
