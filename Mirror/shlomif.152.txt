<p><b>Hacktivity</b>

<p> <p>
I did some work on making sure 
<a href="http://chiqchaq.sourceforge.net/">Chiq-chaq</a>'s output HTML
validated. It turned out to be a rather tedious work. While in the Technion, 
I worked on the List of Mailing Lists Manager, and am now at the stage
where, after I'll add documentation, it would be ready for public 
consumption. It's great that I find time to hack on OSS while studying.


<p> <p><b>Studies</b>

<p> <p>
During the weekend I worked on the Financial Management exercise and almost 
finished it. Today, I consulted my lecturer and using his help I would be
able to finish the rest. I have to hand it tomorrow.


<p> <p>
Yesterday and today I worked on the Intro to Soft. Sys. exercise. So far
I had a good success, and got two of the tests to pass. Now it's time for
the third part.


<p> <p><b>Haifux Meeting</b>

<p> <p>
Eli Billauer gave an entertaining lecture about his Eobj (=easy object)
environment for Perl yesterday. It did not convince me to use it instead of
the built-in Perl environment, but it was still very nice. Right now,
the Haifa Linux Club has a long line of pending lectures, probably up to
the Welcome to Linux series. I do hope I can this time convince everybody
to have a Linux in Action demonstration mini-series instead of a full-fledged
W2L series.


<p> <p>
Other than that, there's an <a href="http://www.perl.org.il/20030612.html">Israeli Perl Mongers meeting</a> 
this Thursday.
