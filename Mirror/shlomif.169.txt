<p><b>Haifux Meeting and Birthday Party</b>

<p> <p>
On Monday, I went to hear a Haifa Linux Club lecture about Real Time and
Embedded in Linux given by Iftach Hyams. The lecture was very nice and
there were many bursts of laugh throughout it. Afterwards, we went to a
restaurant to celebrate Haifux' 4th birthday (which was incidentally
<a href="/person/ladypine/">ladypine</a>'s birthday as well)


<p> <p>
Ori Idan (who drove me back to Hertzliya the last meeting) gave Meir Maor and
me a ride to the restaurant. (the arrangement was that Ori had a car, Meir knew
how to get there, and I neither). We arrived there, and I sat at one end of
the table next to Ori and Jess. The food was good, and Jess told a lot of jokes
throughout the dinner.


<p> <p>
<a href="/person/sun/">sun</a> gave Jess, some other guy and me a ride home. The
first part of the ride was full of jokes, but the second one held a serious
discussion of Intellectual Property and whether "all software should be
free".


<p> <p>
I arrived at home at 1 A.M. and went to bed even later, but had a fun day.


<p> <p><b>Warcraft III</b>

<p> <p>
I finally discovered how I can finish a level I was stuck in. My problem was
that the gameplay was fast, and when I switched it to slow it was doable. I
did not finish it yet, but I'm getting there.


<p> <p><b>Movie: Pirates of the Carribean</b>

<p> <p>
I went to see the movie "Pirates of the Carribean: Curse of the Black Pearl"
yesterday, along with my father and my sister. The movie was very entertaining
and Action-paced. Highly recommended.


<p> <p><b>Hacktivity</b>

<p> <p>
I worked on integrating Freecell Solver with Python using the Python
bindings I wrote. It was quite straightforward as a basis for it was
in the code and all I needed to do was adapt it to my new interface. The
Python debugger was a lot of help in tracking some crashes. Now I have
it working for most Freecell variants.


<p> <p><b>Upcoming Open Source Events</b>

<p> <p>
There's an installation party and conference tomorrow at John Bryce College in
Tel Aviv which I'm going to attend as an installer. Afterwards, on Sunday,
there's a lecture about Mono at the Inter-Disciplinary Center in Hertzliya.
If there's time, I'll also give part of my lecture about CatB.


<p> <p><b>Reading</b>

<p> <p>
I read several chapters out of "Apache: The Definitive Guide", and
chapter 3 of "The House of Arden". I also covered "Homesteading the Noosphere"
in preparation of the lecture on Sunday.
