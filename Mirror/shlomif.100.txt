<p><b>PerlPoint and other Animals</b>

<p> <p>
My on-going presentation on Perl-Point can be found
<a href="http://vipe.technion.ac.il/~shlomif/lecture/Pres-Tools/Perl-Point/">
here</a>. I think I'll throw in a comparison with QuaD-Pres (and possibly 
Power-Point... ;-)) for good measure. I wrote a shell script to upload 
everything to the site using rsync. Then I noticed it kept uploading the 
tar.gz file, because it was kept being generated from scratch.


<p> <p>
Solution: package everything in the makefile, and so if the source files do
not change, neither would the archive, and rsync would be happy. Thursday is 
going to be a bit ecstatic because I'll return home in the morning (after the
Linux Day) and go the meeting in the afternoon. Gabor said I can bring the 
files on a CD-ROM or on a floppy. Hopefully I can just send them to him 
beforehand and he'll put them on his laptop. But maybe I should bring a media
just in case. Better safe than sorry.
