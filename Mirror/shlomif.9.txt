I see it's been more than two weeks since I wrote the last
entry. Oh well.

I had some time off my University project (due to the fact
that I got a little sick and because of the Jewish
holidays), and I invested it in Freecell Solver. Now it is
solves Simple Simon games par excellance, and you can expect
the release of 1.10.x anytime now. Simple Simon tests are
more complex than Freecell ones due to the unique nature of
Simple Simon, so it had been quite an experience.

If you can't wait, the development releases are available on
the site by now.
