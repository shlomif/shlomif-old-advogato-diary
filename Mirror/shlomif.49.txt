<p><b>Life</b>

<p> <p>
I got a stomach mal-function a few days ago and did not feel too well. But now everything seems to be fine. I managed to bike a few times during the weekend, but now I'll have to return to Haifa because I have a complementary precept tomorrow's morning.


<p> <p><b>System Call Tracker</b>

<p> <p>
I did some more work on the WML site, and also started writing an alternate configuration program using Perl, Lex and Yacc. So far, the grammar only processes for the filter expressions, but I think I'll be able to wrap it within the rest of the format.

<p> <p><b>Haifux Lectures</b>

<p> <p>
I wrote a summary for a <a href="http://vipe.technion.ac.il/~shlomif/lecture/Autotools/">lecture
 about GNU Autotools</a>. There's not too much meat inside but your comments are welcome.
