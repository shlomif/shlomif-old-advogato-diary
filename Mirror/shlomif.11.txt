Well, the big news is that I set up the <a
href="http://huamnity.berlios.de">homepage</a> for the
"Humanity - the Movie" project. This project aims to be
the Bazaar way of writing a movie. More info at the
homepage.

Otherwise than that I had some homework and project work
to do so I stayed in Haifa for the weekend. :-(. Roy and I
worked on the project yesterday and today I am working on
the image processing experiment preparation questions.

Had I known what life in the Technion would be like in
advance, I would not have joined it in the first place.


<p> <p>
I'll finish with a joke from "Humanity":


<p> <p>
<i>The Tour Guide:</i> The wall is just there. The wall
exists.


<p> <p>
<i>Tourist:</i> Excuse me, does the wall exists in the
same way that Existence exists?


<p> <p>
<i>The Tour Guide:</i> No, the wall exists therefore
existence exists.


<p> <p>
Think about it!
