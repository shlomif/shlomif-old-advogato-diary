<p><b>CLAN - The Comprehensive Linux Archive Network</b>

<p> <p>
I pondered an idea for this for some time. Yesterday I went to 
irc.kernelnewbies.org there, found <a href="/person/riel/">riel</a> and some other
people and discussed it with it. He liked it so I wrote 
<a href="http://fc-solve.berlios.de/clan/clan.html">whitepaper</a> and posted
it to the Linux Kernel Mailing List. Tzafrir Cohen gave me some useful 
commentary. What it does basically is allow to download, compile and install
kernel modules incrementally while resolving dependencies. Something
like Perl's CPAN or Debian Apt meets the Linux Kernel.


<p> <p>
Right now, I'm pondering how to implement it in a robust enough way, and maybe
should start hacking on a SPEC. riel said hosting should not be a problem, 
but that I'll need to make sure I'm serious about it. If anyone wishes to do
it instead of me, (or bring out ideas, SPEC portions, etc.) feel free to.


<p> <p>
On the IRC, riel and some other guys also discussed Perl modules and objects 
and what you should use them, and also a system they wrote at Connective (where 
Rik-van-riel) works that is something like dmoz meets Slashdot, and he claims 
makes the support guys job much easier. He said something about the code being
in Portugese (variables, function names, comments and all) and that they wish
to clean it up before they releas it. I've seen a Freecell implementation (with
its own solver) code written in French, and it was not something I could begin
to understand. <tt>use English;</tt>!


<p> <p><b>IBM Event and RMS Dinner</b>

<p> <p>
The lectures in the IBM Event where cum-si cum-sa. The Israeli Organization
of Information Engineers guy told a nice joke, and made a useful comment
about open-source in the government. Basically, the government should not be
forced to use OSS because it can stand on its own merits technically and 
philosophically. However, I do think the government should make sure its 
users will not be forced to use proprietary software which they'll have to
pay for.


<p> <p>
An IIS and Oracle site that outputs valid HTML and looks fine in Mozilla, Konq
, Opera, etc. is acceptable. MS Word documents for download (without PDFs or 
HTML) are not.


<p> <p>
Next came Moshe Bar's lecture which confused the hell out of the terms "free
software" and "open source software". Generally Moshe Bar's lecture are pretty 
good, but this time I was very disappointed. I tried to correct him sometimes,
and he dismissed me and there's a discussion of it in the Linux-IL archives.


<p> <p>
Next came Theodor Ts'o lecture. He is not head of the IBM Linux Development 
Center (or something like that) and talked about everything IBM is doing with 
Linux and Open-Source. I hope Mr. Ts'o won't take it the wrong way but the 
lecture was too long and there were too many names and numbers and not enough
meat. I left it a couple of times. (but note my impression from Ted below)


<p> <p>
Next was a brief but to the point lecture about PHP and Zend Inc. which was 
very interesting. I did not learn anything too new but it was interesting.


<p> <p>
Next came a lecture about the Eclipse IDE project. The project has an 
interesting design and goals and is widely deployed, but since I'm not an avid
IDE user (give me konsole, gvim, gcc, make, gdb, perl, perl -d, Subversion, etc.everyday) and found Eclipse exteremely unconventional to what I was used to, I 
went away. I think the lecture was interesting, though.


<p> <p>
I met Ts'o outside, and we had a few chats. In one he explained to me that ext2
uses the standard direct, indirect, indirect-&gt;indirect, etc. convention that 
is common on the UFS, which I learned at at the course Structure of OS in the 
Technion. We also talked about my IP-Noise project and if he can recommend 
anyone who knows where I can forward a "call for adoption" notice. He instructed
me to E-mail him which I did. Another chat (between him, me and several other people) was on Linux for the masses, Linux on PDAs, Life, the Universe and 
Everything.


<p> <p>
He calls Linux "liynex" but otherwise is one hell of a nice guy from my first
impression, and a good speaker. Ted, next time, please include concrete 
examples in your lecture. All those graphs, facts, figures, etc. bored the 
hell out of me.


<p> <p>
Right afterwards was a Linux dinner which we decided to do with RMS or without 
it. (he did eventually came straight from the airport). I was disappointed from
the RMS-part of the dinner, because I did not get to talk to him too much, and 
was pre-empted. Other people were disappointed from me because I did not behave
very well. What was interesting was the company.


<p> <p>
I met two Hebrew University students who work on the MOSIX team. I talked with
one of them about open-source and then mentioned the Cathedral and the Bazaar. 
He said he printed it the same day, and intended to read it. I hope 
"Amnon Barak" reads it as well, and MOSIX will become a true open-source 
project and not just one of those projects with a free software license. Taking
Freecell Solver - I did more than 95% of the work on the code. But it would 
have advanced nowhere, if it were not for the users' feedback, motivation, 
encouragement, ideas, compliments and even the occasional contribution. I'm not
sure it was 100% Bazaar-style, but it was quite close. And even in most 
Bazaar style projects the core group is very small - usually one or two people.


<p> <p>
openMOSIX was supposed to be a MOSIX fork that was done bazaar-style. Now Prof.
Barak is a bit possessive about the source, and so shined away from it. I do 
hope these projects merge in a certain point into one Bazaar-style project 
headed by Barak (or an anarchy-style project like KDE). But at the time being 
Prof. Barak won't accept patches to the code even if they are perfectly fine.


<p> <p>
I then met Mark Veltzer and few people I did not know, and started talking. We
began discusssing the "Microsoft - Good or Evil" endless-discussion. I maintain
that Microsoft should be left alone and suffer from their own mistakes and 
dogma. I also believe Microsoft is smarter than many think it is, and eventually
port stuff to Linux, and adopt a more bazaar-like development style of its 
software. I don't think they will ever go entirely open-source, but I think they
can survive to one extent or the other in an open-source dominated world.


<p> <p>
Making free software is not about getting rid of Microsoft. It's about changing
the rules of the game and making people more free to choose their software, 
and better be aware of their freedom. As was noted in the conference IBM is the 
god-mother of proprietary software, distributed such a long time before 
Microsoft, and still does. It is now one of the largest open-source developers.
I think Microsoft can adapt as well as IBM can. It dumped DOS in favour of 
Windows and MacOS, and can dump both in favour of Linux and MacOS X. This will
give them all other UNIXes for free. (just re-compile) And Windows has become
so over-engineered, over-complicated, over-x86-specific, over 
backwards-compatible, over-bloated, and over-un-understood, that they have 
more profitable pathes to do with the elite group that is supposed to maintain
the Windows XP code. (which is the Linux equivalent of the kernel, glibc, X, gtk+, half of GNOME, bash and a lot of the GNU fileutils etc., Mozilla (IE within),atd, CORBA, and maybe other things I forgot). 


<p> <p>
Granted, some things are nicer in Windows. Multi-threading for instance. But it
would take less time to tweak gdb to better support threads, than it would be 
to fix all the Windows brain-damage around. I once preferred using Win98 over 
Linux for doing non-development stuff. Now I simply can't stand Windows, not 
even Windows XP. My Mandrake system with KDE 3.x and everything on it gives me 
so much more opportunities and is so much more comfortable. I can easily show
that there are things that are trivial in Linux which are not possible in the
Windows XP as it ships from Redmond. Many things.


<p> <p>
If Microsoft wants to beat Linux they would have to seriously hack on the 
already bloated code. But sometimes, if you can't beat them - join them, and I 
think that's what they'll eventually do.
