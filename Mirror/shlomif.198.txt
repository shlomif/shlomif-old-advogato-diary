<p><b>Linux Events</b>

<p> <p> <p> <p>
I attended Aviram Jenik's lecture on Sunday. Before the lecture I had enough 
time to give a quick appetizer in the form of my "Template Toolkit" Lightning
Talk. I received one positive criticism, and two others that said that it
was not very understoodable. I believe they were correct and I understood how
to improve it. (but think it may make it into a seven minutes or ten 
minutes talk).


<p> <p> <p> <p>
Immediately after I was finished (and before I had the chance to hear any 
feedback) Aviram came, and started with the lecture. The lecture was very good,
funny, and interesting. I first believed it was going to be a "preaching to the
choir" type of lecture, but it ended up also bringing up alternatives for
full disclosure, and many cases from the security history. (some of which were
very amusing) The room was crowded, and Shachar (who is also a humorist 
"behesed") also contributed things.


<p> <p> <p> <p>
There was also a Haifux Lecture on SMTP and Qmail by <a href="/person/kilmo/">kilmo</a>. 
It seemed interesting and Eran was there, but I was very tired that day so
I decided to leave prematurely. I dozed off at least twice during the ride
back home, so I guess I couldn't have made it through the lecture.


<p> <p> <p> <p>
I ended up modifying my Template Toolkit lecture and am looking for a chance
to give the modified one before the YAPC.



<p> <p> <p> <p><b>Talk with Ya'el Marksemer</b>

<p> <p> <p> <p>
On Monday, I drove to the Technion with Ya'el Marksemer (the girl who studied
Game Theory with me, and also was Orr's Officemate), and had a very pleasant
talk with her on the way. We discussed many topics. Among them:

<p> <p> <ol>
    <li>
    SQL - she said she studied about databases in a course, and found the
    bare SQL standard very hard to get by with. I told her that database
    vendors create incompatiblity on purpose so people will not want to port
    their databases to something else. I then told her of my (so far failed)
    Extended SQL initiative.
    
    <li>
    <p>
    I told her about a Technion lecturer I know. When I came to see him
    once he was running an old PC computer with fvwm on it probably running 
    Linux. What he did was that he invoked one Emacs window and worked on it
    exclusively.
    
    <p>
    When I came to meet him again, a year ago or so, his computer was upgraded.
    Now, he had a Red Hat system with the Red Hat icon instead of the K, 
    anti-aliased graphics, flashy looking and all. What did he do? Invoke an
    Emacs session and worked in it exclusively.
    
    <p>
    Of course, he was quite old and studied at MIT back then. I'm still very
    fond of him.
    
    
    <li>
    <b>Software Management Stuff</b> - we discussed having private offices 
    (Peopleware, etc.) vs. two or three people in an office. I told her of
    a company I worked for, where people had to move their chairs to let me
    out and she said that was indeed unbearable. I told her that Microsoft
    U.S.A. allocates an office even for interns. Like I said, she was a 
    theoretical computer scientist, but she was still interested.
    
    <li>
    <b>Her Thesis</b> - she said she and her instructor for the M.Sc. were
    now writing a scientific article about the proof she did for his 
    conjecture. She said she only used high-school Combinatorics there, but 
    there was a certain tricky part. I told her I wish to write an article
    for a scientific journal about Freecell Solver, but said I would 
    need someone to tutor me and instruct me exactly what to do.
    
</ol>
<p><b>Forums Threads of Interests</b>
<p>
My post to Hackers-IL's about <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/hackers-il/message/3576">"Reading Open Source Code"</a> took several interesting turns.
First of all we came into conclusion that reading code was relatively neglected
in university, even though it's a very important skill and can possibly teach
students how to write better one. Otherwise, Tzahi Fadida said that some
open source code (and non-open-source code) was very hard to read, and we 
discussed what measures could be taken. We discussed the XP-belief that no 
documentation should be written for the code, because the code needs to be
self-explanatory. And we further discussed the validity of XP and how 
"scientific" it is or should be.

My post <a href="http://discuss.fogcreek.com/joelonsoftware/default.asp?cmd=show&ixPost=98229&ixReplies=3">Some 
    Thoughts on FogBUGZ for Windows</a> on the Joel on Software forum
may be of interest, because it contains a answer by Joel.

<p> <p> <p>
Here's another one: <a href="http://discuss.fogcreek.com/joelonsoftware/default.asp?cmd=show&ixPost=98232&ixReplies=36">More Linux Developers than Windows Ones
</a>. This recent statistics, and what does it mean. (and what would be the 
implications of open source on programmers) An offspring of this post is
<a href="http://discuss.fogcreek.com/joelonsoftware/default.asp?cmd=show&ixPost=98337&ixReplies=23">Open source complexity Issue</a>.

<p> <p> <p>
There was an opinion piece in the Register that was Slashdotted and 
discuss.fogcreek.com'ed. See <a href="http://discuss.fogcreek.com/joelonsoftware/default.asp?cmd=show&ixPost=98395&ixReplies=46">this thread on Joel on 
    Software</a> for some of my comments.

<p> <p> <p>
Finally, if you want to converge the two most common themes in the JoS
forum (outsourcing and open source vs. the world) to one big conspiracy theory,
<a href="http://discuss.fogcreek.com/joelonsoftware/default.asp?cmd=show&ixPost=99201&ixReplies=48">look no further than here</a>.

<p> <p> <p>
All in all, mailing lists, the Joel on Software forum and Whatsup.org.il are
a huge productivity killers! But they do add some insights and understanding 
even to very knowledgable persons.


<p> <p> <p> <p><b>Linux Problems</b>

<p> <p> <p> <p>
Here's a bootload of problems I've encountered recently. Ever since I installed
the Bitstream Vera TTF fonts, many fonts on my desktop got uglier. I don't know
why it happens and I don't know how to fix it, but I'll look into it. (removing
the package did not help).


<p> <p> <p> <p>
I also was able to install and use kernel 2.6.0 today, with some advice from
a Linux-ILer (to install the module-init-tools package). At first, the Internet
did not work because I did not compile the Tulip-class modules (they were off by
default), but now everything is in order. (I'm writing this E-mail on 2.6.0)


<p> <p> <p> <p>
The mouse cursor however, became much faster after the upgrade. I found a good 
workaround by issuing "xset m 10/10" (play around with the numbers), but 
all in all it is quite frustrating, and I'm not sure I'm happy with it as it
is now.


<p> <p> <p> <p>
Finally, an old problem which still was not resolved. When I play an mp3 file 
using XMMS with artsd, then I must set my buffer size to over 1000ms 
(precisely that - 999ms does not work) or else the sound sounds garbled. 
It does not happen with directly to ALSA playback or with KDE's Noatun. It is
annoying because the music gets played for another second when I press the
stop button or when a song is switched.

<p> <p> <p>
<b>Recent Update:</b> - my computer accidently rebooted
itself when I shut down X, and some of my files got corrupt. Luckily I had a backup and was able to restore .ICEauthority and the .kde sub-dir to a working state.
Other than that, I found a way to change the font in gvim
to something more likable. Now for the other apps.


<p> <p> <p> <p><b>Hacktivity</b>

<p> <p> <p> <p>
I populated some of the <a href="http://perl.org.il/kwiki/index.cgi">Israeli
    Perl Mongers Wiki</a> (created a page there for non-Perl Israeli Projects)
and created <a href="http://benschmaus.com/cgi-bin/twiki/view/Main/WwwForm">a 
    Wiki hypertext base for WWW::Form</a>. I also wrote some of the outline
for the second draft of an essay I wrote a prelimary version of some time ago. 
Now comes the hard part of writing it in DocBook, entirely.


<p> <p> <p> <p>
I also wrote the <a href="http://discuss.fogcreek.com/joelonsoftware/default.asp?cmd=show&ixPost=99574&ixReplies=23">Cross-UNIX Portability - Facts 
    and Myths</a> technical article. (first on paper and then on computer - don't ask).

Too much time E-mailing. Far too less coding. Teh teh.
