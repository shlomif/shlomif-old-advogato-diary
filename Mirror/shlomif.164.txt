<p><b>August Penguin II</b>

<p> <p> <p>
I attended the August Penguin II event yesterday. It was very nice and
I met many people I knew there. At first Shachar Shemesh gave an instructive
presentation about the Linux activities in Israel the past year. Then, there
was a lecture about MOSIX by one of its Hebrew University workers. It was
very nice as well. Afterwards, <a href="/person/moshez/">moshez</a> gave a lecture about
PyPy, instead of the Python internals lecture that appeared in the agenda.
Moshe is a very entertaining lecturer and the lecture went very well.


<p> <p> <p>
Then came the geek trivia, which pitted two groups of three "geeks" and "nerds"
against each other. It was very fun. And finally, came the key signing party
, which I took part in and signed the keys of 20 people or so.


<p> <p> <p>
There were a few glitches there, as far as I was concerned. First of all, I
discovered the building did not have any coolers and I had to drink water from
the taps of the restroom. Then, it was too cold in the lecture hall, and I
had to leave once or twice to regain my senses. Finally, my ride back to home,
disappeared during the key-signing party, which caused me to have to take the
bus again. But all in all, they did not spoil the fun.


<p> <p> <p>
After the event was over, I went back home, ate, and went to sign everybody's
key. It turned out <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/linux-il@cs.huji.ac.il/msg28626.html">some
    of the key could not be checked out of the servers I tried</a>. (read the
thread for more information). However, it turned out <a href="/person/mulix/">mulix</a>
who organized the key signing party, prepared a keyring with all the keys,
and was about to send it to everyone for signing. Thus, I was able to sign
the rest of the keys.


<p> <p> <p><b>Freecell Solver</b>

<p> <p> <p>
I discovered a game of Simple Simon that could be solved by hand, but not
by Freecell Solver (which gave up after checking only the initial state). So
I set out to discover why. Apparently there was a function there which was
responsible for performing the initial move, only it had a bug. I only had
to remove one = from an <tt>&lt;=</tt> operator and the bug was fixed and
the game was solvable. Hah!


<p> <p> <p><b>Reading</b>

<p> <p> <p>
I finished a large part (most?) of "Games, Diversions and Perl Culture :
Best of the Perl Journal". I also read the Freshmeat GUI Toolkits feature
and started reading ESR's "The Art of Unix Programming" which is very
interesting so far.


<p> <p> <p><b>Subversion</b>

<p> <p> <p>
I wrote a couple of tests for my Issue #1297 patch, and indeed the unpatched
Subversion failed them both. However, I was told the patch is not correct
because it does not handle some working copy parameters correctly.


<p> <p> <p><b>LM-Solve</b>

<p> <p> <p>
After releasing version 0.8.0 I discovered a bug and released version 0.8.1.
Now I think I did not document the Hexagonal Planks ID in the man page of
the executable so I'll need to release 0.8.2... :-). In any case, I also
revamped the <a href="http://vipe.technion.ac.il/~shlomif/lm-solve/">LM-Solve
    homepage</a> and now maintain it separately from my homepage.


<p> <p> <p>
Finally, I announced LM-Solve on Freshmeat.


<p> <p> <p><b>Dmoz.org</b>

<p> <p> <p>
I finally got permission to edit the Perl "FAQs, Help and Tutorials" category
on dmoz.org. I created a tutorials sub-category and will move all the
tutorials there. I might create other sub-categories there if I feel the
main one becomes too crowded. Let me know if there's anything you'd like to see
there.

<p> <p><b>Lectures</b>

<p> <p>
I prepared <a href="http://vipe.technion.ac.il/~shlomif/lecture/Perl/Graham-Function/">a lecture about my solution to the Graham Function
    Perl Quiz of the Week</a>. This time I used PerlPoint, which enabled me
to quickly translate the summary into the lecture itself. Here's
<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/hackers-il/message/3349">a discussion
    of it on Hackers-IL</a>.


<p> <p>
I also prepared a summary (but not the slides themselves) for a lecture about
LM-Solve. Both are intended for the next Israeli Perl Mongers meeting.
