I woke up today at 02:00 AM which is quite early for what I'm used  
to. I then turned on the computer and started working on it, and  
then tried to go back to sleep, but could not so I continued  
working on it until breakfast.

I managed to finally be able to understand how to work with  
BitKeeper. It requires quite a lot of commands just to commit  
the changes into the master repository, so I'd better write scripts  
to automate it (like Linus Torvalds did). I'll probably use it for  
<a href="/proj/LM-Solve/">LM-Solve</a>, just to get a feel of how to work with it  
and what it can do.

Other than that, I did all kinds of bit and pieces like making the 
shoes of the BSD daemon a bit nicer. I went running at around 9 
O'clock and close to home, I again encountered the same girl jogger 
I saw yesterday (wearing a differentyl coloured set of clothes). 
Maybe she has the habit of running everyday at around this time.
