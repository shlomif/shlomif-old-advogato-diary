<p><b>Vipe is back online</b>

<p> <p>
Vipe returned online this morning. After logging in, I discovered that
some of my mail folders had bootloads of messages which I had to delete,
and that the mail bounces caused the Mailman-based mailing lists to 
make me in "no mail" mode. So I had to cover them and change it back.


<p> <p>
In any case, without vipe I felt that I was missing a rib, and am very
happy that it's back online.


<p> <p><b>Getting MikMod to Play using Artsd</b>

<p> <p>
I wrestled a bit trying to find a solution to get the command line mikmod
player to play using Artsd. I believed this was the case in Knoppix, but
then discovered it plays there using OSS. After contemplating coding a 
libmikmod driver for Arts, I found an easier hackish solution:


<p> <p>
<tt>artsdsp /usr/bin/mikmod -d 2</tt>


<p> <p>
Smile! You're on camera!


<p> <p><b>Hacktivity</b>

<p> <p>
I advanced a little in the Hebrew translation of ESR's 
"Homesteading the Noosphere". Other than that, after vipe returned, I've
been looking at <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=854">Subversion Issue 854</a>. The instructions there for reproducing the bug
worked flawlessly on my computer. So I closed the bug, and sent in a patch
for a regression test.


<p> <p><b>Reading</b>

<p> <p>
I read a chapter or two from "The House of Arden". I also covered some
chapters from "Apache: the Definitive Guide". Some of the later chapters
were interesting but as a whole the book is quite disappointing.


<p> <p>
Finally, I finished "The Art of Unix Programming". Now I'm looking for 
something else to read online.
