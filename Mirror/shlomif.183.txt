<p><b>GIMP Lecture at Telux</b>

<p> <p>
I gave a lecture about the GIMP on Sunday to the Tel Aviv Linux club. It 
went pretty well, but there were few people there (less than the previous lecture). Some things sparked a bit of discussion, like whether Graphic Artists can
learn the GIMP Scripting or do they need something more foolproof. 


<p> <p>
After the lecture I talked to two guys. One of them was a system administrator
in a high school who converted some of the server infrastructure there to 
Linux, and wanted to conduct an experiment to see if development could be
taught there.


<p> <p><b>Quad-Pres Hacking</b>

<p> <p>
I released a new stable version of Quad-Pres, with some critical bug-fixes. The
problem was that upload did not work, because of a leftover file which was 
revamped without proper modifications to the rest of the code. So, I added
some tests and now have some items on my pressing to-do list.


<p> <p><b>Rub-a-dub-dub Translation</b>

<p> <p>
It's finished! Did not take too long at all, but maybe the article was
just short. I have applied some corrections by going over the translated 
text. Now I'm looking for someone to go over the translation and 
copy-edit it.


<p> <p><b>Setting up ViewCVS for Subversion</b>

<p> <p>
I wanted to set up <a href="http://viewcvs.sourceforge.net/">ViewCVS</a> for 
the Subversion repository. So I read the install file of ViewCVS from the 
CVS, and followed it. The first problem I encountered was that 
<a href="http://www.contactor.se/~dast/svnusers/archive-2003-10/0393.shtml">the 
    Python SWIG bindings of Subversion refused to install</a>. I received
a hint in response, which led me to a solution. (an explicit 
<tt>make install-swig-py-lib</tt> command)


<p> <p>
Then I installed and configured the ViewCVS config files and they refused to 
work due to an unfound module error. Turns out the problem was that Apache 
did not pass the <tt>PYTHONPATH</tt> environment variable to the CGI scripts.
After RTFMing, I found a solution: a simple "PassEnv" directive.


<p> <p>
Then it worked, but I'm not sure that it traced files across copies. I may
try Chia-Ling Kao's SVN::Web script later on.


<p> <p><b>Haifux Welcome-to-Linux Preparation Meeting</b>

<p> <p>
We held a meeting in preparation for the "Welcome to Linux" series. 
<a href="/person/kilmo/">kilmo</a> was there as he returned from abroad, and I was surprised
to see him there. Here is the <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/haifux@haifux.org/msg00498.html">summary of the meeting</a> which I took down.


<p> <p><b>Studies</b>

<p> <p>
Studies are beginning tomorrow. I have to get up early to catch the bus,
which should arrive a while before the first lecture.
