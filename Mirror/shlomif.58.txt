<p><b>RPM Spec for LM-Solve</b>

<p> <p> <p>
I started writing an RPM Spec tempalte for it based on the SPECs of a few Perl packages from Mandrake Cooker. I got
a few building errors, and eventually contemplated that
they were incompatible with older versions of Mandrake. By
using a stable version from RPM-Find, I was able to complete it, and it worked beutifully, at least on my system.


<p> <p> <p>
LM-Solve 0.5.4 is now RPM-enabled. I posted an announcement on Linux-IL for people to test that it works well on their RPM-based systems. So far I received one reply.

Adrian encountered a different behaviour of presets with 
the --prelude feature. Eventually, it turned out that the
quotes in the preset string confused the command line chopper, as it does not support them. Once removed, it worked the same as for me.


<p> <p> <p>
Now, we agreed to add support for these quotes into the chopper, to avoid such further annoyances. Now that I think of it, I think I'll prototype it in Perl, first.


<p> <p> <p>
As a side note, I should add that I asked Adrian whether he would wish to receive intermediate versions of the book, and he said he would. I think I should ask more people privately like this.


<p> <p> <p><b>A diagram</b>

<p> <p> <p>
My mother needed me to prepare a block diagram for her. I used Dia for the job. It took us some time to get it just right. Then, when I printed it, it came out very blocky. But then I opened the EPS, converted it to a PNG with a resolution of 600 DPI, and so got a much larger and accurate image. Then, it printed fine.


<p> <p> <p>
Dia is a nice program, but has some quirks. I would have used Visio if I could, but we don't have a copy of it on our Windows system. I have it at the Technion, though, but now I'm in Tel-Aviv.

<p> <p><b>Freecell Solver Site</b>

<p> <p>
I discovered that the XHTML 1.0 validation image had a border, so I removed it. Now what I would like to do is create some macros to encapsulate some of the common patterns there.


<p> <p><b>Studies</b>

<p> <p>
The project is progressing. Not very quickly, but there's progress nonetheless. I set up to meet Roy on Monday, and hopefully pair programming would let me have some more discipline. I talked with my apartment owner, and he said
that Yaron is not going to renew his contract next year. That means I'll have to hang some ads looking for an apartment partner.

Eran and I got 94 in EE Lab 3, and I'm really glad for it.
