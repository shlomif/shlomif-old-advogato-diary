Yesterday I went to watch "Bridget Jones's Diary"
in
the theatre and also stayed up late and watched "Lethal
Weapon 4". Both were pretty good movies.

Otherwise than that, I'm making progress in several of my
Open-Source/Open-Content projects. The R2L KDE Applet now
looks much better (but Guy Keren still has some demands
about it); I finished writing the part about references to
functions and closures in the
<a
href="http://vipe.technion.ac.il/~shlomif/lecture/Perl/Newbies/lecture3/"
>third perl lecture</a>; and I was able to fix most of the
bugs in my LaTeX document thanks to help from the
subscribers of the Haifux' mailing-list.

Orr Dunkelman has not yet updated the Haifux' site to show
my re-run of the
<a
href="http://vipe.technion.ac.il/~shlomif/lecture/Lambda-Calculus/">
Scheme and Lambda-Calculus</a> lecture. Oh well - he's in
the U.S.A now AFA he told us.


<p> <p> <p>
I will be going to the Technion today, and I should
remember to borrows the book "Computation Structures" from
the library and write a SPEC of the MAYBE. It's one of the
proposals I have for a Haifux' Project.
