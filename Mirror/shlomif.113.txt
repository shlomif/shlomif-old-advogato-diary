<p><b>Web-site Changes</b>

<p> <p>
I changed the "back to my homepage" image hover style to define
a background color so it will be entirely highlighted when the cursor
is on it. Then I did a CSS2 trick, and changed the a:hover style
inside the navigation bar to orange so it will look better with
the yellowish-green background. Konqueror and Mozilla process it
fine and so should MSIE too. (albeit I noticed IE indents the 
navigation menu, which I don't understand why it should do so)


<p> <p>
Afterwards, I downloaded gif2png and converted the "Back to my Homepage"
image from GIF to PNG. It went very smoothly and kept the transparency 
and HTML behaviour fine. I then modified the WML template to refer to it 
instead of the GIF. This is one step towards a GIF-free site. I don't think
Unisys can tyrannize Israeli-hosted sites, but it would make the site more
globally-friendly and can be thought of as a step towards solidarity with the
countries in which it does have a patent.


<p> <p><b>Technion Connectivity</b>

<p> <p>
Connectivity to the Technion is sporadic. Sometimes it works wonderfully;
sometimes it does not work at all; sometimes it is very slow. The 012.net guys
told me it had to do with the Technion. And strangely enough, the huji.ac.il 
domain works perfectly all the time. Very strange. And my iglu.org.il account
at actcom seems to encounter the same problems the same time my home 
workstation does.


<p> <p>
Something is wrong with the Technion's configuration.


<p> <p><b>Hacktivity</b>

<p> <p>
I finished covering ESR's CatB in the "Solving - Origins and Orientation" 
lecture. But I cannot upload it to vipe because of temporary Technion 
connectivity problems. And I don't have my technion E-mail accounts either. 


<p> <p>
I wrote a lot of E-mails and there's an active discussion on Hackers-IL now
about what "software engineer" and "software engineering" means. I like it when there is an activity like that. I asked some questions of Linux-IL, but the SNR ratio of the responses I received was not too high. I did found an answer to the text wrapping around an image question (thanks to Ilya) and possibly can find a good substitution
for Word XP for Linux to write mixed Hebrew/English documents.


<p> <p>
Finally, I added a few terms to the Terminology in the FCS arch doc, fixed
the TODO file a bit, and wrote a message on how it measures against the Joel
Test.
