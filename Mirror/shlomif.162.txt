<p><b>Perl Mongers Meeting</b>

<p> <p>
This Thursday the Israeli Perl Mongers had a meeting where Stas Bekman gave
a several hours talk about mod_perl 2.0. Many people attended the meeting 
(about 20-25), and we had a lot of fun. The lecture was very instructive,
and taught a lot about what can be done with mod_perl besides writing
simple CGI scripts.


<p> <p>
After the meeting was over, I explained to someone about Subversion as he
said he had problems with CVS and was looking for a good alternative. (I 
eventually wrote an <a href="http://perl.org.il/pipermail/perl/2003-July/002634.html">E-mail to the mailing list</a> about it). Oron Peled gave me and Kfir
Lavy a ride home as he was returning home to Haifa. We asked him about his
past experience with UNIX and what he does now, and we had a very interesting
conversation on the way home.


<p> <p><b>Project Introductions at the TAU OSS Course</b>

<p> <p>
Yesterday, I went to a lecture of the Tel-Aviv University Open Source 
development course. There was a lecture there about CVS, which I interrupted
with some corrections and additions. After the lecture several people and I
introduced our projects to the students.


<p> <p>
I gave a <a href="http://vipe.technion.ac.il/~shlomif/lecture/Freecell-Solver/project-intro/">10 minute introduction about Freecell Solver</a> (that was 
accompanied by a demonstration of kpat solving Freecell). One of the
<a href="http://xparam.sourceforge.net/">Xparam</a> developers gave an overview
of his Xparam project. Shachar Shemesh said some words about Hamakor NPO, and
then introduced the WINE project to the students.


<p> <p>
The students in the course are expected to choose a project to work on and to
perform about 300 hours of work each on it. The Xparam guy got three students
who were interested in the project and gave him their details. When I returned
home, and checked my E-mail, I found out from the course initiator that two 
students expressed interest in Freecell Solver as well, and would probably 
contact me. I did not hear from them yet, but I'm looking forward to it.


<p> <p><b>Subversion and Perl Makefile.PL - problem and solution</b>

<p> <p>
I now started to maintain LM-Solve using Subversion. However, after importing
the project into Subversion, I encountered a problem that I remembered
from Linux::Kernel::Module::Builder: the Makefile.PL also did something with
all the files under the .svn/ files. (and in my case even corrupted the working
copy). 


<p> <p>
A quick Googling made me realize that the solution was to install the 
development snapshot of <a href="http://makemaker.org/">ExtUtils::MakeMaker</a>
and use it instead. This has worked, and the Subversion resident Perl guru
told me the same thing on the IRC.


<p> <p><b>Subversion Neon Usage</b>

<p> <p>
Subversion has a problem of asking confirmation of a certificate for
as many times as the https:// path has path components, as it keeps
trying upward components. I wrote <a href="http://www.contactor.se/~dast/svn/archive-2003-07/1390.shtml">a fix for this issue</a>, and posted
it to the Subversion development list. Ben Collins-Sussman <a href="http://www.contactor.se/~dast/svn/archive-2003-07/1419.shtml">criticized it</a>
saying it was a workaround and maybe we are using Neon (the WebDAV client
library) wrong.


<p> <p>
I inspected the code of Neon and found it does indeed return a plain 
NE_ERROR error if the certificate's authenticity failed. This makes it 
impossible to tell if we failed due to that or due to something else
altogether. We decided to wait for the Neon project head to tell us
what he makes of it, and what we should do.


<p> <p><b>Dmoz.org Perl Tutorials Category Blues</b>

<p> <p>
My application for editing the Dmoz.org Perl "FAQs, Help and Tutorials"
category was rejected for the third time. This time, there were problems
in the grammar of my submission (which I'll make sure won't happen next time)
and some vague critique of what is present in my exis
