<p><b>Studies</b>

<p> <p>
On Wednesday, there was some construction on the Tel-Aviv-&gt;Haifa road so 
the inter-city bus came late on Wednesday, and I had to take a later bus
and arrived late at class. Nevertheless, it seems it just started, and I was
able to write everything that had been written on the board in my notebook.
I then took the material for the previous lecture that was given in the
week in which I missed the lecture.


<p> <p>
Other than that, I've been a bit busy solving the exercises in Statistics.
They seem to be pretty easy once you get the hang of them. Now, I have an 
exercise about Linear Regression which seems very easy, but the page with
the formulas is a bit illegible.


<p> <p><b>Scanner under Linux</b>

<p> <p>
Turns out my scanner (UMAX Astra 3450) works fine under Linux. I first tried
it with kernel 2.4.x in which it did not work too well. After trying it in 
Windows, and then rebooting, it worked well again. With kernel 2.6.x, I needed
to compile the USB sub-system and load some modules with various parameters. 
(which I did not do already, but now I have the right configuration file to do
it). 


<p> <p><b>WWW::Form</b>

<p> <p>
Ben Schmaus (WWW::Form's head developer) finally commited the most up-to-date
files into <a href="http://stalker.iguide.co.il:8080/svn/www-form/www-form/">the WWW::Form 
    repository</a>. I continued the work by first generalizing the "tr_class", 
"tr_hint_class", etc. parameters to be "container_attributes" and 
"hint_container_attributes". Then I documented everything that I added.


<p> <p>
Following that, I wrote a couple of tests to one of the utility functions 
in the module, and hope to continue this trend of writing tests. Ben is a bit
busy at work now, so he cannot invest a lot of time into it. We are still 
discussing things via Instant Messaging, which is very convenient.


<p> <p><b>Anti-MSIE Campaign</b>

<p> <p>
I finally started out the
<a href="http://t2.technion.ac.il/~shlomif/no-ie/">anti-MSIE campaign
    on my web-site</a>, after frustration from Microsoft's abuse of its
users, the web-developers community at large, and their apathy towards users
of non-Windows systems. Also pay attention to the large no-IE icon at the side-bar. Feel free to join!


<p> <p><b>Telux Meeting</b>

<p> <p>
I've been to <a href="/person/gby/">gby</a>'s Telux presentation on Sunday, about 
Embedded Linux. He gave some guidelines for error-free development of 
Embedded Linux systems, and introduced uClibc (a libc that can be customized
with just the right functionality), BusyBox (an all-in-one UNIX toolchain, that
is also configurable to death), Kaction (formerly Tiny X), and FLTK (the Fast
Light Toolkit). It was very interesting and lasted only one hour.


<p> <p><b>Egged Site</b>

<p> <p>
The <a href="http://www.egged.co.il/">new incarnation of Egged's (the 
    Israeli national bus company)</a> stopped working with Konqueror, and
only a basic functionality half-works with Mozilla. I filled in the feedback
form (an E-mail to webmaster@egged.co.il did not work), and got this reply:


<p> <p>
"Hello Shlomi. I'm sorry, but the site is designed only for the Explorer 
browser. I will thank you for your understanding."


<p> <p>
This answer is very laconic, and does not address half of my complaints 
there, nor assured me that they were going to be fixed. I answered him in 
return, but was not answered. Guess I'll have to find some other means of 
complaining.
