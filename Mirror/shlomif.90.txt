I got myself to read the Howto. It was quite a good and enlightening read, despite my initial impression. One thing I can say about documents like that is that they are <b>scary</b> - do this, don't do that, do this, don't do that. Sorry that I exist, fellows!

Whatever. I don't think <b>I</b> actively defied any of the guidelines presented there. So, who is John Galt? (or Jane Galt for that matter)

Yoram promised he'll send us the typo corrections of the project's report this evening, when he'll be home and near the printout of the report. Meanwhile, I asked him how to implement the mailing list stuff and am halfway through implemnting it. Unfortunately, Roy cannot help me, because his work keeps him too busy.

I was tired in the early afternoon, so I went to the apartment and layed down. I did not get to sleep, but the rest was still refreshing.

Played a lot of PySol today, and managed to write another paragraph in my translation of "Joel Spolsky's Strategy Letter III - Let me go back". I wonder when the Hebrew site is going to be online.

An idea cooked up between Roy, my mother and I about getting credit for some work on Freecell Solver. I went to a Game AI lecturer in the CS faculty today, and he asked me to send him the project spec and some links by E-mail (which I did) and that he'll evaluate them and try to find a suitable project supervisor when he finds some time. In any case, I can default on doing a project for Yoram and the Computer Networks Lab about collecting AI statistics distributively. (which is on lower priority than working on the FCS core).
