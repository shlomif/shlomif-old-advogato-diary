<p><b>New Story Update</b>

<p> <p>
The new story is progressing nicely. I already received one relatively positive
review of it from my cousin, and a laconic remark from someone else who
I referred it to him, and just said he did not like it too much. But still,
it isn't finished, so I'm unwilling to show it to the world at large.


<p> <p><b>State of the Onion</b>

<p> <p>
I read Larry Wall's recent
<a href="http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2004/08/18/onion.html">State of the
    Onion</a>. It was very amusing as most of the things that Larry has
written. I liked it a lot. In any case, he says there that he has been
hospitalized for a large part of the passing year (but now he is more or
less OK). I hope Larry will stay in a good physical condition.


<p> <p><b>Story for the Software Freedom Day</b>

<p> <p>
I wrote <a href="http://www.whatsup.org.il/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=3480">a
    story about my interaction with Adrian Ettlinger</a> (in Hebrew) for the
Israeli story contest of the Software Freedom Day. As for activities in this
day, we wanted to have several stands in various shopping centers, but we did
not have time to organize anything, because it was on such a short notice.
I hope we'll have a better luck next year.


<p> <p><b>The Olympic Games</b>

<p> <p>
The Olympic Games are over. Israel has won <a href="http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull&amp;cid=1093402929569">its first Gold Medal by Gal Friedman</a>. One thing that impressed me was the speed in
which some of the gymnasts moved. They did it very quickly. In any case,
I did not watch too much of it, and spent most of the time working on the
computer.


<p> <p><b>HTML Navigation Menu</b>

<p> <p>
After a long time of neglect - I started working on the unified HTML
navigation menu interface. I am basing my work on <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/HTML-Widget-sideBar/">HTML::Widget::sideBar</a>. However, it seems
that the added benefit of it was very little. It is possible writing the
relevant logic from scratch would have taken me less time, than trying to
find out how to work around its idiosyncrasies. At the moment, I have patched
H::W::sB, sub-classed it and wrote a lot of logic on my own.


<p> <p>
Still, what I have now functions pretty nicely, and I'm making more progress.
So I'm a dumb-ass but optimistic.


<p> <p><b>Welcome to Linux</b>

<p> <p>
I started preparing the <a href="http://shlomif.il.eu.org/lecture/W2L/Blitz/slides/">Blitz lecture</a> for the upcoming <a href="http://www.hackers.org.il/mediawiki/index.php/W2l">Welcome to Linux series</a>. This year, we aim for it
to be conducted (at least partially) by three clubs (in Haifa, Tel Aviv, and
Jerusalem), and so it requires quite a lot of organization. Aside from the
lecture, I was also placed in charge of the site.


<p> <p><b>Movies</b>

<p> <p>
I went with my dad to see Shrek 2 in the cinema. It was very entertaining,
with a very high-quality animation, and very funny. There are many parodies
of other films embedded in it. I also finished watching Spiderman 1 in the
DVD. It was very entertaining. It seems that I liked most of the Comics-based
films I have seen.


<p> <p><b>Mozilla Firefox - A War Story</b>

<p> <p>
I decided to give Mozilla Firefox a try. So far so good. However, after
downloading the latest 0.9.x release, I encountered a case where installing
a certain plug-in did not work. This has caused me to try the trunk release
(where some things could not be installed because <tt>install.rdf</tt> was
not supported.) and one of the branches release (where some things also
did not work). Eventually, I returned to 0.9.x and managed to install everything
I needed.


<p> <p>
Firefox is a better browser than Mozilla Core. It is faster, and gives one
better control over the extensions and themes. (you can easily update or
uninstall them). Very nice. Other than that, I discovered the
<a href="http://www.chrispederick.com/work/firefox/webdeveloper/">Web
    Developers Extension</a> for Firefox and Mozilla. So far I used
the PNH Toolbar, and I must say that the Web Developers Extension gives
everything PNH gives and more. It also eliminated one thing I used Opera
for - validating a web page by uploading its content.


<p> <p><b>Talash' Mandrake Woes</b>

<p> <p>
<a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/talash/">Michael
    Perelmutter (aka Talash)</a> has recently bought a new computer and
wanted to install Linux on it. He tried Mandrake for a while, then
SUSE which he decided he liked better. However, SUSE had some problems,
so he tried Debian, which did not work either. So, he returned to Mandrake.
Now, when talking to him on the ICQ, I learned that the network card did
not work (despite having worked perfectly the previous time he installed
Mandrake) , and so I dropped by.


<p> <p>
The first thing I tried was to see if I can configure the card manually
using /sbin/ifconfig and /sbin/route. This worked perfectly. Then, after a lot
of tweaking, we realized the problem was that Mandrake was using an "ifplugd"
thingy to control the card, which was not compatible with it. Quickly setting
the rather obscure <tt>MII_NOT_SUPPORTED</tt> flag in
<tt>/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0</tt> (not in
<tt>/etc/sysconfig/networking</tt> as I previously thought) did the trick.
We then had a problem that <tt>/etc/resolv.conf</tt> was filled with the
address of the router. This was solved after the correct DNS servers were
inputted manually, and a reboot.


<p> <p>
After that, I just showed him to use Easy URPMI to set the sources of the
packages, and as he was about to leave, we started updating everything using
MandrakeUpdate. The GUI tools turned out to be incredibly unhelpful in getting
the network up and running, but they were reported to buggy in this release
of Mandrake.


<p> <p><b>O'Reilly-Net Article</b>

<p> <p>
I finished writing another article for O'Reilly-Net. It has good prospects of
being published, but I did not get any reviews for it yet despite having
sent it to some of my friends, and the
<a href="http://www.onlamp.com/">OnLAMP.com</a> editor. If you have some
spare time and wish to review it, <a href="mailto:shlomif@iglu.org.il">drop
    me an E-mail</a> and I'll send it to you.


<p> <p><b>Events</b>

<p> <p>
I've been to two Tel Aviv Linux Club meetings. In the first one,
<a href="/person/gby/">gby</a> gave a nice presentation about
<a href="http://www.asterisk.org/">Asterisk</a> - an open-source solution
for managing phone networks. I enjoyed it very much. In the second one,
<a href="/person/mulix/">mulix</a> and <a href="/person/ladypine/">ladypine</a> gave an entertaining
and enlightening presentation about the latest developments in the world
of the Linux kernel, as seen through attendees of the Ottawa Linux
Symposium.


<p> <p>
I just returned from an Israeli Perl Mongers meeting. Uri Bruck gave a
presentation about using Perl to automatically fill OpenOffice forms. It was
very nice. He chose to use XML::Simple, and it reminded me of how much I
generally hate it. Then Gabor, first explained about the status of the
Perl community in Hungary, and then about how can one contribute to Perl.
I did not attend the last presentation to its end because the person
giving me a ride had to go to catch a movie. Hopefully, I can
read the rest of the presentation online.
