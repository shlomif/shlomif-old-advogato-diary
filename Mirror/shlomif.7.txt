Roy (my partner for the IP-Noise project) and I spent
the weekend working on the project. We finished writing 
the perl arbitrator, and started converting it to C. We 
are giving a presentation about it this Tuesday.

I've been playing "Simple Simon" in 
<a 
href="http://wildsau.idv.uni-linz.ac.at/mfx/pysol/">PySol</a> 
a lot lately. I 
am thinking of adapting Freecell Solver so it would be 
able to solve "Simple Simon" games too, but so far the 
code is in very preliminary stages.

There's a meeting of the Haifa Linux Club today. We're 
going to have a short lecture about KickStart, and then 
discuss the R2L project, the Welcome to Linux series and 
other such stuff.

Now, back to IP-Noise. My partner and I required a C 
implemntation of a Readers/Writers Lock for the POSIX 
threads library. We tried searching for it in Google, but 
could not find anything relevant. Eventually, I remembered 
the <a href="http://zthread.sourceforge.net/">ZThreads 
library</a> which has an implementation of it in C++. I 
spent some time yesterday converting it to ANSI C and it 
seems to work nicely, at least for our needs.
