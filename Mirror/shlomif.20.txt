<p><b>A New Bike</b>

<p> <p>
I finally have a new bike which is a blue Raleigh A4
(yes, like the paper size). I rode it several times the past
weekend and this one, and it feels pretty good. Some things
in it are a bit of an over-kill, if you ask me, but all in
all I'm happy.


<p> <p>
I'm supposed to take it to the shop were I bought it after a
month or so, for some maintainance.


<p> <p><b>User's Guide for the IP-Noise Project</b>

<p> <p>
Roy is finally through with his Milu'im. We decided that we can
add more meat to our final report by writing a User's Guide. We decided
to write it in HTML, after ruling out POD (which is very limited)
, LaTeX (which is harder for MS-Word to import) and DocBook (which
I still have to learn). POD is still great for writing man
pages, and Roy agreed with me that the nroff syntax is much more
horrid.


<p> <p>
We will explain setting up and using the front-end in detail. I believe I
have GraphViz around, which should prove useful for including diagrams that explain
about the Markov chains.
