<p><b>Certification</b>

<p> <p>
Certified <a href="/person/RoUS/">RoUS</a> as Master, because of his amusing homepage and work on Apache and other projects. I stumbled across one of the pages of his sites on Google, and went to the root of his homepage. Besides, he was already certified
as Master and certified himself as a Master, so it was common courtesy.


<p> <p>
He calls himself "Rodent of Unusual Size" at Freshmeat, and now I realize RoUS stands for it. RoUS, is "The Princess Bride" your cult movie as well? "'A battle of wits? [nod] To the death? [nod] I accept.'; 'Great, so pour the wine'"


<p> <p><b>Update on my goings</b>

<p> <p>
I spent the last time hacking on all kinds of things and nothing in
particular. I managed to bike a lot (when it wasn't raining) and enjoy myself. Otherwise I maintained a low online profile, because I figured out that absence makes the heart grow fonder, and I ended many people's fuses beforehand.


<p> <p>
I'm starting to study again in the Technion on March 3. Otherwise, I'm perfectly fine: alive and kicking.
