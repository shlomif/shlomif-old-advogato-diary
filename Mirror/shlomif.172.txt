<p><b>Bug in uniq on my system</b>

<p> <p>
A bug isn't it? My system is Mandrake 9.1, and neither the uniq from
RedHat 6.2 nor the latest from the GNU diffutils exhibits this problem. It
broke one of my scripts and so I installed the latest uniq to my $HOME/bin
directory.


<p> <p><b>Objectivism and Open Source Essay</b>

<p> <p>
I wrote <a href="http://t2.technion.ac.il/~shlomif/philosophy/obj-oss/obj-oss/book1.html">an essay titled "Objectivism and Open Source" today</a>. It aims
to explain to Objectivists why open source is a Good Thing&lt;tm&gt;. Read
and flame away!


<p> <p><b>Subversion Issue #854 Revisited</b>

<p> <p>
Apparently, I did not notice some comments in the issue in the Subversion
bug-tracker, that said that the behaviour has changed, but still was not
as expected. So, the bug was re-opened and I created a new fix, that checks
if "svn revert ." is done on a newly added directory and throws an error
if it does. Quite a trivial fix, but I also wrote a regression test to
make sure this is what happens.


<p> <p>
It was eventually applied with small fixes. One less bug before Subversion
1.0.


<p> <p><b>Larry McVoy Interview</b>

<p> <p>
I went to the BitKeeper homepage today to recall the name of the push
command, and saw on its front page that <a href="http://www.linuxworld.com/story/32618_1.htm">Linux World
    conducted an interview with Larry McVoy</a>. This was partially in
response to a <a href="http://www.linuxworld.com/story/32608.htm">previous interview with Bruce Perens</a>. I wonder how I could have missed it.


<p> <p>
I searched the Perens interview for BitKeeper and read this part. Basically,
Perens accuses McVoy of threatening him every time he meets him. McVoy denies
these accusations in his interview. It's one's word against the other. I do
know Larry McVoy has threatened several other people with ligitation online.
And he does seem to me to be quite hot-headed. So I tend to believe Perens.


<p> <p>
This all brings me back to <a href="http://better-scm.berlios.de/bk/relicensing_bk.html">my conclusion that reverting the BitKeeper license would be a good
    idea.</a>. The reason the source code was hidden in the first place,
was because some companies modified it to subvert BitKeeper and disable the
OpenLogging facility. This is all very well, but I doubt a substantial number
of them would have become paying customers.


<p> <p>
With its current licensing scheme, BitKeeper would <b>never</b> become
the state of the art. Never. While it is technically superior to any free
software alternative (at least for now), hardly anyone dares touch it with a
ten-foot pole because of its license. If its licensing change to something much
saner, and its source code be revealed, it could, OTOH, eventually conquer the
market and be distributed as part of major distributions. I don't know why
McVoy does not realize that, but it is mainly his loss.
