<p><b>Certification</b>

<p> <p>
Certified both of Chen Shapira's profiles to Journeyer. She may not be a full-fledged open-source hackeress yet, but she is an important part of the glue that hold Hackers-IL and Linux-IL together.

<p> <p><b>Talk with Chen</b>

<p> <p>
I talked with Chen Shapira on the phone yesterday. The talk was very friendly, and I was glad to hear she was not mad about me after saying the forbidden "chicks" word (when referring to young girls) on Hackers-IL. We covered several issues, which I won't mention hear, albeit some of them were entirely non-serious.
