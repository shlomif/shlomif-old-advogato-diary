<p><b>Sys-Call-Track</b>

<p> <p>
<a href="/person/mulix/">mulix</a> said that in his diary, but I might
as well too. I hacked on the perl script that generated some
code their, and cleaned it up a bit. Most of what I did had
to do with making the code more perl5-ish instead of the
perl4-like mess it used to be.


<p> <p>
I talked with Guy Keren, the other prominent developer of
Sys-Call-Track and he said that what he also would like to
see is the entire philosophy of the script re-factored. But
hopefully, I can do that by doing several incremental
changes, rather than one complete re-write.


<p> <p><b>Freecell Solver Lecture</b>

<p> <p>
I started translating the points I wrote to HTML slides. I
finished quite a lot of them, but it will take me some time
until everything can be placed on-line.


<p> <p><b>Studies</b>

<p> <p>
I have a precept on Thursday for "Algo Design", due to the
fact that my T.A. has been drafted into the Army with a
Turtle-8, and the replacement T.A. does not have the same hours.


<p> <p>
Furthermore, I have to sit with my Computer Graphics and
"Algorithms" partners, before the weekend.


<p> <p><b>Learning C/C++</b>

<p> <p>
My sister, Noa, called me and requested that I buy for her a
book on learning C and C++. Today, I bought the book "A Book
on C", which I can still recall from "Intro to CS".
Hopefully, it would be suitable for her.


<p> <p>
Her original idea was that I should buy her a book in
Hebrew, but I told her they are probably sub-standard. Going
to <a
href="http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/users/yechiel/">Prof.
Kimchi's site</a> strengthened this, and I saw there that he
recommends "A Book on C".
