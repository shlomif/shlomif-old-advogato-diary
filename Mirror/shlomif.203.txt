<p><b>Aarrggh! My Hebrew has turned into Question Marks</b>

<p> <p> <p>
I edited a Hebrew HTML file with kedit, but forgot to set the encoding
appropriately. The Hebrew was edited fine. However, when I closed it,
I realized (after some experimentation) that the Hebrew characters have
all turned to question marks. The actual ASCII question mark letter.


<p> <p> <p>
I ended up losing the entire document. What the hell? Fury... fury... fury.


<p> <p> <p>
To prevent it once and for all, I added this to my .bashrc:


<p> <p> <pre>
function kedit
{
    LC_CTYPE=he_IL.UTF-8 /usr/bin/kedit $*
}
</pre>

<p> <p> <p>
The reason I don't use an i18n'ed locale by default is because it causes my
fonts to become uglier. How lame is that? &lt;sigh /&gt;


<p> <p> <p><b>DocBook continued</b>

<p> <p> <p>
Well, Bob Stayton helped me and instruced me the how to modify to the code
of the DocBook/XSLT <tt>itemizedlist</tt> handler to make it propagate the
role attribute as a class. Now, it works and I'm happy. Still I think it's
a huge mis-feature that role is not propagated for any element.


<p> <p> <p><b>Version Control Article</b>

<p> <p> <p>
My <a href="http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2004/01/29/scm_overview.html">Version
    control article</a> now has many more comments. Many of them were in the
vain of trying to protect CVS and why it should still be used. I think this
is not true, and new projects should not start with CVS. I expect CVS to be
used in years to come, but be considered hugely deprecated just as RCS and
SCCS are still used today, but are also deprecated.


<p> <p> <p>
It was <a href="http://www.osnews.com/comment.php?news_id=5858">referenced
    on OSNews.com</a> (courtesy of <a href="http://www.eugenia.co.uk/">Eugenia
    Loli-Quero</a> who also contributed to the Better-SCM site and
comparison), where there are more comments, and
it also hit Whatsup in <a
    href="http://www.whatsup.org.il/modules.php?op=modload&name=News&file=article&sid=2646">this
    feature in Hebrew</a>. There it seems to form a discussion of the Linux
Kernel Development Model, why it requires BitKeeper, and whether it's a good
thing.


<p> <p> <p>
As a result, or just out of word of mouth, I received a great deal of E-mails
about the Better-SCM site lately. Someone even sent an addition to put in
Visual SourceSafe and CM Synergy to the comparison. (which I bounced
because it wasn't a patch to the XML file). I have modified the pages a bit
since then. Next, I plan to put its source on a public Subversion repository
so people can contribute more easily.


<p> <p> <p>
I also started sending a Newsletter about Better-SCM to all the people who
contacted me about it. ("Cathedral and Bazaar"-style) It worked pretty nicely
so far and I received a lot of useful input. Someone, however, wished to be
unsubscribed from it, and suggested I ask before I add someone to the
Newsletter. I have to think about it a little, but think I'll go with
unsubscribe on demand, given that most people are not very responsive.



<p> <p> <p>
Finally, there's now <a href="http://better-scm.berlios.de/mailing-list.html">a
    new mailing list - better-scm-discuss</a>. Several people have joined now,
and there was some active discussion. That's good.


<p> <p> <p><b>Perl-Begin</b>

<p> <p> <p>
I managed to do quite a bit of work on
<a href="http://perl-begin.berlios.de/">Perl-Begin</a>. I moved its source
to a Subversion repository at opensvn.csie.org (which offers a very discreet
and unintrusive service, albeit sometimes the connectivity seems slow), and
then added a lot of content and changed the CSS somewhat (made it more modular
and nicer). Finally, I created a newsletter for it as well, and sent some
announcements to the people who contacted me about the site. One of them
replied with some useful suggestions. :-)


<p> <p> <p>
In any case, I contacted <a href="/person/ask/">ask</a> and the rest of the beginners
workers about contributing to learn.perl.org. Eventually, I found out that
perl.org had a hardware failure and so work on learn.perl.org was stalled.
What I did do was write a "learn/" section to
<a href="http://www.perl.org/">www.perl.org</a>, which will take some time
until it is proof-read, and integrated into the main site. What I did there
was simply link to the appropriate places on learn.perl.org and perl-begin.


<p> <p> <p>
I'm glad I could find some time to do a lot of really productive work. I missed
hacking, and hacking on web-sites, while not being as challenging as hacking
on code, is still fun and rewarding.


<p> <p> <p><b>Hackers-IL</b>

<p> <p> <p>
Check <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/hackers-il/message/3619">this
    message of Hackers-IL for a post I made to Hackers-IL</a> in regards
to the new and annoying Yahoo Groups limitations. (Hackers-IL is hosted there).
There are three possibilities: accept the Status Quo, pay Yahoo Groups for
getting a primum service, or move to our own service.


<p> <p> <p>
We decided that being hackers, the last option would be best. The problem
is that several people have resources at their disposal, but none has the
time (except me). So, I went out and contacted <a href="/person/sun/">sun</a>, one of
the beak.hamakor.org.il's admins to host the <tt>hackers.org.il</tt> domain
there. He told us we should send a description of what Hackers-IL is all
about to the appropriate list and he'll see if everything can be arranged.


<p> <p> <p>
I wrote <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/hackers-il/message/3634">a
    charter</a>, which was criticized as being too long to be effective and
Arik Baratz wrote a shorter one, which was still very good. I ended up revising
both charters and
<a href="http://www.iglu.org.il/shlomif/hackers-il/charters/">putting
    them online</a>. We decided we are going to use the shorter charter for
contacting the beak admins and for further purposes like that, and the more
verbose one for putting on the future site.


<p> <p> <p>
The discussion was pretty long, and eventually we debated if it was off-topic
or whatever. We reached a conclusion that it was just a "meta" discussion,
which was a necessary evil, but that it was still annoying. This was towards
the end when everything stabilized, so it just closed the discussion.


<p> <p> <p>
Yesterday, I sent the mini-charter in its final form to the appropriate list,
with some explanations on what we need in the present and in the future.


<p> <p> <p><b>Mozilla's Firefox</b>

<p> <p> <p>
I'm glad the Mozilla people changed the name of their browser so it
won't clash with the Firebird database. I also like the new name. It is
almost certainly based on the Biblical story where Samson sets fire to the
tails of 400 foxes and drives them to the Philistines camp to throw it into
chaos and destruction. There's a nice symbolism with trying to do the
same with MSIE, but I don't know how many of the target audience know the
Old Testament well enough to realize that.


<p> <p> <p>
Still, the name is very cool, even without recalling the story. Of course,
I have a feeling that it might start a new trend: Fire+[Animal]. Firecat.
Firedog. Firedove. Firebear. Firepenguin. Etc. All these names are very cool,
but one will have a hard time distinguishing between them. But who is John
Galt?


<p> <p> <p><b>How Good are my Technion Grades?</b>

<p> <p> <p>
I posted <a href="http://discuss.fogcreek.com/joelonsoftware/default.asp?cmd=show&ixPost=110136&ixReplies=71">a post to the Joel on Software forum about
    my Technion grades</a>. This seemed to be a mis-calculation as many people
took the opportunity to criticize me, claim I was no-good or lazy, etc. They
obviously haven't been to the Technion...


<p> <p> <p>
Here is the creme de la creme of the discussion by someone calling himself
"Caliban Tiresias Darklock":


<p> <p> <pre>
Shlomi, just a bit of constructive criticism here... and this *is* supposed to
be constructive...

 You come across as childish, inexperienced, and belligerent. Nothing you have
 written interests me. What little sticks out in my mind is not positive. You
 sniff at the college for not having a standards-compliant web page, as if
 anyone really cares. You sneer at CVS for not having a few minor features, as
 if anyone really cares. You solve a few basic puzzles, and build a
 presentation generator that you use to create a bad Perl tutorial. Then you
 come in here and say you know you're a good engineer.

 Unfortunately, you're not. You're just a competent Perl programmer. But
 engineers solve problems; if you expect to impress me with your work, do
 something that's relevant to someone other than yourself. Why in the world
 would I want to read your ramblings about SCHEME or run some program you wrote
 to solve mazes? I know why I would want to read *my* ramblings about SCHEME or
 run some program *I* wrote to solve mazes -- because I'm arrogant and
 self-involved. I love writing stupid little things for no good purpose, just
 because I can. Every engineer does.
</pre>

<p> <p> <p>
Maybe I should check the definition of "constructive" in the dictionary again...


<p> <p> <p><b>Melissa Joan Hart - Pictures</b>

<p> <p> <p>
You innocently type <a href="http://images.google.com/images?q=melissa+joan+hart&hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&sa=N&tab=wi">"melissa joan hart" into Google and search it for images</a> and what do you get in the first hits? That's right -
soft porn.


<p> <p> <p>
A few notes are in order. The Google search for MJH (=Melissa Joan Hart) is
perfectly fine and clean and leads to various fan sites and pages. Secondly,
some of the other pictures in the search are not provocative at all.
Thirdly, the first pictures are absolutely horrid, IMO. I don't have a problem
with sexual or even provocative photos - some of them are very nice - but
these are done in very bad taste. (I guess ESR was right when he noted that
most porn is disgusting)


<p> <p> <p>
Moreover, this is not entirely an issue of "child-safety", keeping "innocence",
etc. I just wish that the Google images search was a bit smarter about this,
as the Google regular search is. It is possible that it was the anti-thesis
to these pictures that made them get a higher rank.


<p> <p> <p>
In any case I found
<a href="http://www.asamnet.de/~sperbera/mjh/scans-fan/melissa-joan-hart_diddys-scans_001.jpg">a
    very nice picture in the first page of hits</a>. Hart (fully groomed)
standing among automn leaves. She looks a bit sad, but the picture is very
beautiful. Having downloaded it, I noticed it was scanned and of low quality.
So I decided to reduce its size using the GIMP. The latter simply opened it
in %50 scaling ratio, which made it look very decent, so I just reduced it to
this size. Finally, I placed the picture in my Konq+Xmms Virtual Workspace
instead of a very nice picture of Gabrielle Anwar, which I had there for
several generations now. (I guess it's always time to move on)


<p> <p> <p><b>Melissa Joan Hart - Silly Etymology</b>

<p> <p> <p>
Well, enough Cybersex for now and let's just discuss MJH's etymology. Her
full name is "Melissa Joan Catherine Hart". Considering the fact that
Catherine is a variant for "Catherina" we can see she has no less than
6 private names:


<p> <p> <ol>
    <li>
    Meli (short for Emily)

    <li>
    Lisa (short for Elizabeth, or Alisa)

    <li>
    Jo (the "Little Women" short for Josephine)

    <li>
    Anne

    <li>
    Cathy

    <li>
    Rina (a common Hebrew female name meaning sing-song)

</ol>

<p> <p> <p>
Six names for a girl who isn't even thirty yet. (!)


<p> <p> <p><b>Solving</b>

<p> <p> <p>
Well, for something a bit more serious. I had some kind of enlightenment
in regards to
<a href="http://vipe.technion.ac.il/~shlomif/philosophy/solving/">Solving</a>.
Now, I simply say that instead of trying to bring the open-source world-like
Distributism model into western-world-countries, I am instead going to propose
that competing leaders will compete for controlling the countries instead of
the "official" elected government. This will create a multi-tude of leaderships
all competing for the same niche, and doing so logically and reasonably, instead
of one leaderhip who cares more about his public image than about being a
honest one.


<p> <p> <p>
I revamped the content of the site (without re-writing it from scratch). Then,
I linked to it on the IRC in several channels, and also on a web-designers'
list I am a member of. From the replies I received, it seems that I did not
explain myself correctly enough, and people thought it was Feudalism or
even worse. This means something is still wrong there. I still got some
useful replies and input. Guess it's time for more revamping...
&lt;sigh /&gt;
