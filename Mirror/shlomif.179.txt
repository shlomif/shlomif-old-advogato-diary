<p><b>BitKeeper</b>

<p> <p> <p>
IBM has recently bought Rational, the producers of Rational ClearCase, which
is an SCM system competing with BitKeeper. Does it mean all IBM employees
(including many Linux kernel hackers) are forbidden from using BitKeeper? ;-)


<p> <p> <p>
I suppose only Larry McVoy can tell. I talked about it on the IRC with
some people and they said IBM is so large, that it can hardly be considered
as one entity. Still, I'm not sure it is a separate entity as far as
copyright law is concerned.


<p> <p> <p><b>Hacktivity</b>

<p> <p> <p>
Various bits and pieces. I worked a bit on <a href="http://perl-begin.berlios.de/">perl-begin</a>, compiling it again after
the move to the new computer. Then, I added some links to web-forums
there. I also worked a bit on the Haskell for Perl Programmers lecture,
adding stuff on arrays.


<p> <p> <p>
I worked on the Homesteading the Noosphere translation. I finished the chapter
"Ownership Rights and Reputation Incentives", replaced my own translation
with a corrected first chapter I received from someone else, and also went
over the existing translation and corrected various stuff.


<p> <p> <p>
I also modified my homepage to include <a href="http://t2.technion.ac.il/~shlomif/open-source/interviews/">the interviews section</a>, and placed Adrian
Ettlinger's interview online. You probably know of it from the front-page
article.


<p> <p> <p><b>Haifux Lecture</b>

<p> <p> <p>
Been to the latest Haifux lecture on Monday. <a href="http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~artstein/">Ron Artstein</a> talked about <a href="http://www.haifux.org/lectures/81/">Multi-lingual Typesetting</a>. It was basically a coverage of the
constraints that written languages imply on getting them typesetted. It was
loads of fun and amusing.
