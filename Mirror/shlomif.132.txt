<p><b>Women in Linux Cont.</b>

<p> <p>
I was contacted by a few members of LinuxChix. One of them told me the HOWTO was directed at men (possibly abusive) and that
the equivalent guide to women was in the works. Very well, but I still think that trying to convert the Linux male community at large to a "non-abusive" behaviour is not practical. Especially when the FAQ considers making a pass on, staring, and telling blond jokes abuse. But who is John Galt?


<p> <p>
A subtle point that is not understood by many people is that a private person or organization is legally allowed to be racist and even discriminatory. The Roman-Catholic church restricts priesthood to males, and there is nothing <b>legally</b> wrong with that. If a person feels it is discriminatory he should move to another church, become atheist, or fork a pan-sexual Catholic church.

Another esteemed member of LinuxChix pointed to the fact that I said "take some abuse" while I meant "handle some abuse". I fixed it in my diary entry. I guess it sometimes shows I'm not a native English speaker.

I will hint that things have heat up a bit in the Haifa Linux Club arena because of my diary and subsequent transacations. 


<p> <p><b>IRC</b>

<p> <p>
I met <a href="/person/mulix/">mulix</a> yesterday on #offtopic at the kernelnewbies IRC server. (quite a nice channel), and added a signature to his E-mail message in the process:

<i>My opinions are crazy but they make sense. Insane sense, but sense nonetheless.</i>


<p> <p>
I think I overheard it somewhere, though. Can anyone here report on prior art?


<p> <p>
I discussed two main topics there: BitKeeper and why Larry McVoy could benefit from a more liberal licensing scheme. And glibc running on the FreeBSD or NetBSD kernels. Apparently, it is working there, but no-one yet tried to take a pure ANSI C or POSIX program, download its i386 Linux binary over FTP, and run it as is on the FreeBSD machine.


<p> <p>
I quoted Knuth ("Beware of bugs in the above code. I have only proven it correct, not tested it"), and the other guy quoted Dijkstra, and we had a lot of fun. I really wonder whether it is possible to achieve full or parital binary compatibility between Linux and FreeBSD/NetBSD this way.
