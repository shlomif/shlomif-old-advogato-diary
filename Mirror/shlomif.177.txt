<p><b>Rosh Hashana</b>

<p> <p>
Today is Rosh Hashana - the Jewish beginning of the new year. So, yesterday's
evening we had a family dinner with the extended family. Unfortunately, many
people were abroad, and another sub-family were visiting their in-laws. Still
, it was very fun.


<p> <p>
I also greeted several people in the IRC and in the Linux-IL mailing list. I
truly hope it would be a good new year with few harms and disappointments
for everybody benevolent out there.


<p> <p><b>DVD Playing (cont.)</b>

<p> <p>
I downloaded and installed the new version of Ogle from the RPMs/SRPMs I
found at its site. Now it plays the DVD I tried very nicely, with a much
better interface than mplayer (or kmplayer for that matter) and with
DVD menus and all. Very nice.


<p> <p>
That put aside it seems that mplayer has a bug in relocating the position
within the film. (it also happens for MPEG films).


<p> <p><b>Hacktivity</b>

<p> <p>
I did some work on Subversion: placed svn-push inside the Subversion
repository, created a branch for it for future developments, and clarified
some things in the mailing list and the IRC.


<p> <p>
Then I took a break and started writing the
<a href="http://vipe.technion.ac.il/~shlomif/lecture/Perl/Haskell/slides/">Haskell for Perl Programmers</a> presentation. <a href="/person/wli/">wli</a> helped
a little after I queried him on the IRC. There are still things I'd like to
add there, but it's quite OK as it is.


<p> <p><b>HTML Blues</b>

<p> <p>
While working on the presentation, I decided that I want to emulate the
&lt;table border="1"&gt; look with CSS. I asked it on the <a href="http://www.webdesign-l.com/">web-design list</a> and someone answere me with a recipe.
I was able to customize it to emulate Konqueror's look and feel. But then
when I tried it on the slides, it did not work.


<p> <p>
After a long investigation, I finallly found that if I remove the DOCTYPE
everything works again. Then I found out that the problem was that my
selector was <tt>table.border1 &gt; tr &gt; td</tt> instead
of <tt>table.border1 &gt; tbody &gt; tr &gt; td</tt>. After that was applied
it was solved in both Konqueror and Mozilla.


<p> <p>
Then someone I consulted with on the IRC reported that it does not work
in Internet Explorer. After some investigation, it was discovered that
MSIE does not support the child selector (<tt>parent_tag &gt; child_tag</tt>)
at all. Aaaarrggghhhh! So, now either I make a non-IE compatible site, or
switch to <tt>table.border1 td</tt> (which may cause problems in the future),
or apply class elements to all the &lt;td&gt; tags inside. I can also kidnap
Bill Gates and threaten to kill him unless Microsoft makes MSIE more standards
compliant and makes newer versions of it available for
free download, but that would be too sadistic for my reputation.


<p> <p>
MSIE Die Die Die!!!!
