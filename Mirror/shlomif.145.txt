<p><b>The Go-Linux Conference</b>

<p> <p>
A conference for promoting Linux in Israel took place in the Hilton Hotel some
days ago. There had been a lot of buzz about it beforehand, and a lot of
prepartions. I believed I was going to study throughout the entire today, so
I did not took a very active part. I eventually attended the event from about
midday, after attending a class in the morning. I must say it went extremely
well and everybody seemed to think so as well. Hackers and Suits integrated
nicely to give an exciting yet accurate depiction of the Linux world and
potential. The conference was financed by People and Computers and many
industrial companies.


<p> <p>
I came mostly to talk to people I know, but also attended a presentation, the
free software developers panel and the Perl-IL meeting. I bought a Perl in
Israel T-shirt for 50 NIS, but forgot it there when I exchanged some books.
(the Israeli Perl Master have taken it, so I'll get it eventually).

Refer to the <a href="http://plasma-gate.weizmann.ac.il/Linux/maillists/03/04/threads.html">Linux-IL mailing list archive for April</a> and

my record of it</a>.


<p> <p><b>Perl Beginners Site</b>

<p> <p>
My Perl beginners site moved to a more
<a href="http://perl-begin.berlios.de/">Permanent Location</a>. As for the
standard rant+suggestions regarding the suitability of the Perl online world
for newcomers: I was not happy from most of the comments I received in the
Advogato post. Most of them beat around the bush in one way or another.


<p> <p>
I am going to do my best to improve the situation and hope others would take
notice of it as well. At the moment, too many resources of the Perl world are
claimed by too few entities. I'd like the situation to improve.
