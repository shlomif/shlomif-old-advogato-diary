<p><b>August Penguins Event</b>

<p> <p>
The first lecture about Embedded Linux was very good
and interesting. The second lecture about TCP spoofing
was good, but had a boring (IMO) topic so I drifted
away. The first lecture took a bit too long so Orna
told us to stay for the second one, but people voted
with their feet. (later on I told her that cancelling recesses is usually a bad idea, and she agreed)

<p> <p>
The movie "Revolution OS" was good. I did not learn anything new, but there were a lot of funny bits, and it
was interesting to see the faces behind the names.

<p> <p><b>#!/usr/bin/perl</b>

<p> <p>Spent some time preparing a decent site, and you can
<a href="http://humanity.berlios.de/usr-bin-perl/">
check it out</a>. I'm still not sure that I want to Slashdot it, but it seems that I'll have to.

<p> <p><b>Autoconf Lecture</b>

<p> <p>
It's tomorrow so I took some time to review the slides. I also uploaded the updated ones to Vipe, and used rsync this time. I <b>love</b> rsync.
