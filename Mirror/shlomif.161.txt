<p><b>Hacktivity</b>

<p> <p>
My Fix for Subversion Issue #1311 turned out to be faulty, and I discussed 
the best to really resolve it with one of the Subversion developers. Next,
I provided a <a href="http://www.contactor.se/~dast/svn/archive-2003-07/1322.shtml">fix for Issue #1267</a>
(have to say "no" several times to reject SSL certificate), which I had to 
<a href="http://www.contactor.se/~dast/svn/archive-2003-07/1390.shtml">update</a> after a modification in the Subversion code.


<p> <p>
Next I talked, yesterday, with Ben Collins-Sussman on the IRC about an issue I 
found in the bugtracker, and he suggested a way to resolve it. So I 
<a href="http://www.contactor.se/~dast/svn/archive-2003-07/1407.shtml">
    implemented it and added a new feature</a>.


<p> <p>
Nothing of what I did was applied yet, which is a bit frustrating, but I hope
a core Subversion developer will find the time to review and accept my patches.


<p> <p><b>Studies</b>

<p> <p>
I met with my Micro-computers partner on Thursday, and we compared the
two versions of the exercise that we solved. We shortly came to a combined
version. Then there was the issue of handing it out which was resolved 
by me doing so on Saturday, when my parents and I travelled to move things
out of the apartment (see below).


<p> <p>
Since I only study on two days in the next semester, and it should be my last
, we decided to stop keeping the apartment lease in Haifa. So we went there,
and took our things, and moved them back to Tel Aviv. We took quite a lot 
of things and needed a few hours and several transactions to move everything.


<p> <p>
At one time, I climbed up the stairs (7 floors) and when I arrived I was
all sweaty, so I was told to take off my T-shirt, and after a while replace it.


<p> <p><b>Subversion Hosting</b>

<p> <p>
I encountered another problem with Subversion that took me some time to
resolve. Subversion kept rejecting my SSL certificate and asking for
confirmation. By talking on the IRC with some people, I was finally able to
resolve this.  Apparently, the problem was that I rsynced the SSL certificates
from my localhost back to the server, and so ran it over, and invalidated what
I had in the Subversion configuration.  


<p> <p>
I resolved the problem by generating a new certificate and syncing the Svn
configuration with it, and then making sure the SSL overriding won't happen
again.


<p> <p>
Another problem solved!
