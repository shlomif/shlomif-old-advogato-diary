First entry here!


<p> <p>
I returned home from the Technion, after working on the
university project and arranging stuff for it most of the
week. The project in question is the
<a href="http://comnet.technion.ac.il/~cn1w02/">
Linux IP-Noise Simulator</a> which aims to be a
sophisticated simulator for Linux (and in the future,
maybe other systems).

I have several plans for the weekend, but I have to
prioritize them to get things straight. Most burning things:
write a Qt R2L plug-in (don't ask...) and get Hebrew LaTeX
to work. And attend Moshe Zadka's lecture about CVS.

I hope you enjoyed reading this entry as much as I enjoyed
writing it. ;-)
