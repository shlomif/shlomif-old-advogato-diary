<p><b>YAPC::Israel::2004</b>

<p> <p>
The <a href="http://www.perl.org.il/YAPC/2004/presentations.html">presentations
    list</a> for 
the <a href="http://www.perl.org.il/YAPC/2004/presentations.html">"Yet 
    Another Perl Conference" in Israel, 2004</a>. So, it's final that 
I'm going to give a lightning talk about 
<a href="http://www.perl.org.il/YAPC/2004/presentations.html">the 
    Template Toolkit</a> and a 60-minutes long <a href="http://vipe.technion.ac.il/~shlomif/lecture/LM-Solve/slides/">presentation about LM-Solve</a>.


<p> <p>
Now I need to prepare the presentation about the Template Toolkit, but first
I'm waiting for the notice about which formats are acceptable for submission
,so I won't work twice. Meanwhile, I'm planning it...


<p> <p><b>KDE Problem and its Resolution</b>

<p> <p>
The "Konqueror" and "Home Directory" buttons of the KDE panel stopped working.
I found out the very command line <tt>kfmclient openProfile webbrowsing</tt>
did not work at all, not even from the konsole. (got a "KDEInit could not 
execute kfmexec" or something like that message). After some investigation,
I realized that it worked for different users.


<p> <p>
At first I was able to resolve it by creating a 
<tt>$HOME/.kde/share/kfmclientrc</tt> file with some settings there. (this
is after some investigation of its source code). But then
yesterday, it broke again. Renaming .kde to .kde-bak resolved the problem, but
made me lose all the settings. So I started renaming directories inside it,
and seeing if they change anything. After a long time I found out that renaming
applnk-mdk resolved the problem. Then I tried just deleting the 
konqueror.desktop file there which also made the problem disappear.


<p> <p>
All in all, I wasted a lot of good hours on this problem which could have been
invested in something more productive. Whatever, now I'll know what do when
it happens again.


<p> <p><b>Gimp Patch</b>

<p> <p>
Now I can tell that I <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/gimp-developer@lists.xcf.berkeley.edu/msg05715.html">updated</a> my 
<a href="http://t2.technion.ac.il/~shlomif/grad-fu/">Gradient-Fu</a> patch to
the latest development version of the GIMP. I received some helpful comments
from the core developers on the mailing list and on the GimpNet #gimp IRC 
channel.


<p> <p>
What this patch does is create Procedural Database functions for manipulating
gradients, thus allowing them to be manipulated from withing scripts. Here is 
<a href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=129675">the Gimp Bugzilla
    Issue</a> for it, where one can follow its development.


<p> <p>
The patch is not complete yet, as there are some gradient manipulation routines
that can still only be done in the gradient editor. But I'm getting there. The
patch was scheduled for inclusing in Gimp 2.2, because the developers are 
anxious to get Gimp 2.0 out soon.


<p> <p><b>What is "Computer Science"</b>

<p> <p>
<a href="http://www.advogato.org/person/kilmo/diary.html?start=67">kilmo</a>: 
I think that defining "Computer Science" solely as "The science that deals 
with the study, implementation and creation of algorithms" is incorrect and 
tries to convey some political agenda. By all means, "Computer Science" deals
with the entire whole of programming for a computer, not just theoretical 
algorithms. What you describe is better defined as "Algorithmics". 


<p> <p>
Let's look some definitions. The <a href="http://en2.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science">Wikipedia entry</a> say: "In its most general sense, computer 
science (CS) is the study of computation and information processing, both 
in hardware and in software. In practice, computer science includes a variety 
of topics relating to computers, which range from the abstract analysis of 
algorithms to more concrete subjects like programming languages, software, 
and computer hardware. As a scientific discipline, it is a very different 
activity from computer programming and computer engineering, although the 
three are often confused. ".


<p> <p>
The Free Dictionary says: "computer science - the branch of engineering 
science that studies (with the aid of computers) computable processes 
and structures". And you can <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=definition%20of%20computer%20science&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8">find 
    more in Google</a>.


<p> <p>
So limiting the definition of Computer Science to pure theoretical 
Algorithmics is probably not a rational thing to do. By all means, it includes
many areas that are more practical and applied.


<p> <p><b>A Productive Day</b>

<p> <p>
Yesterday was a productive day. I prepared several questions from the 
pending Statistics homework, and also worked on the GIMP patch, managing to
do a lot of work. Eventually, I was interrupted for a while by the KDE 
problem, but I was still very productive. Today is a bit slower with 
all the E-mail reading/web-surfing/arrangement stuff, but I hope to get
on the swing soon.


<p> <p><b>Haifux Site</b>

<p> <p>
<a href="http://www.haifux.org/index.html">Haifux</a> has a new site courtesy
of <a href="/person/ladypine/">ladypine</a>. It is based on her and mine original design
of the <a href="/proj/syscalltrack/">syscalltrack</a> site. I also contributed some comments
in <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/haifux@haifux.org/msg00777.html">the 
    discussion about it</a> in the mailing list.


<p> <p><b>An anatomy of Wikis</b>

<p> <p>
Recently I had to work with several Wikis, and I can testify that the syntax
or implementation of several of them could made using them a bit frustrating
at times. For instance, Chiq-Chaq's heavy reliance on JavaScript made it 
unusable on Konqueror. Also, Kwiki seems to have a relatively poor syntax,
and some things are simply not possible in it. It is however, supposed to be
very easy to set up.


<p> <p>
The Wikipedia seems nice for what I dealt with so far. It has a very powerful
syntax and also allows uploading of images and stuff like that.
