<p><b>Linux Events</b>

<p> <p>
On Friday there was the conference and installation party. I spent most of the
time installing RedHat on a few computers. One installation was done through
VMWare which gave some problems in installing the xpdf RPM. Other than that,
a guy I tried to install a system for him, brought his computer there
and we again failed to install it. Then he drove back home and brought his
new computer, on which the installation went fine. (he also drove me back
home).


<p> <p>
Then there was a raffle, which I did not took part in and so did not earn
anything, but it was fun to watch, especially as one name (of someone who
wasn't there) came up three times.


<p> <p>
On Sunday, I went to the Hertzlia Inter-Discplinary Center to hear a lecture
about Mono (the open-source .NET implementation), and also was able to give
a lecture about The Cathedral and the Bazaar series. We were about 10 people
there.


<p> <p>
Finally, on Monday, there was a coordination meeting for the Haifa Linux Club
Welcome to Linux series, which I volunteered to be responsible for some of
the tasks there. They rejected my suggestion to make a shorter "Linux in
Action" series, claiming that the first lecture was about that already. I
still think the W2L as it is, wastes too much of our time, while giving
very little in return to the beginners.


<p> <p><b>Hacktivity</b>

<p> <p>
This and that. I worked on implementing the Patsolve logic into Freecell
Solver. It is working now, but does not give as good results as Patsolve
has. I'll have to analyze the results to see if there's a bug.


<p> <p>
I also worked on <a href="http://t2.technion.ac.il/~shlomif/Devel-LineTrace/">
    Devel::LineTrace</a> - a Perl module to assign callbacks to lines in the
code without modifying it. (for debugging purposes, like adding prints).


<p> <p>
I also went over the CatB lecture and fixed typos. There were quite a few of
them and two of which (one which I forgot) crept up during the lecture. :-)


<p> <p><b>Vipe is Disconnected</b>

<p> <p>
vipe.technion.ac.il is disconnected because it's lying in the Technion's
dormitories network which was entirely disconnected to facilitate dealing with
the worms attack. This means part of my homepage and the Haifa Linux Club
homepage and mailing lists are inaccessible, and I cannot read my primary
E-mail account. The Technion staff is now on vacation so it's not going to
be fixed until Sunday.


<p> <p><b>Reading</b>

<p> <p>
I read a lot from "The Art of Unix Programming", as well as some chapters
out of "The House of Arden". I also advanced a little in "Apache : The
Definitive Guide". The latter seems a bit boring and technical to me,
and I'm not entirely sure I need this information.
