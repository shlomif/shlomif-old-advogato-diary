<p><b>Studies</b>

<p> <p>
We presented the Software Systems project on its lesson on Tuesday. The
presentation went very well, and the lecturer was impressed from both
our project and the project of the other team. We'll have to see which
team will win, but even the losers get a score of 95 or so.

Other than that I attended the final class hours for the subjects for
this semester, and worked on the Financial Management homework. Evidently,
it turned out that its solution was posted for us on its site. The semester
is ending, and now the tests period start. I have a test of Financial 
Management on Sunday, and afterwards a long break (two weeks IIRC) before the
next test.


<p> <p><b>Hacktivity</b>

<p> <p>
Nothing much. (that's being in the Technion for you). I worked a bit
on Quad Pres while being at home (and discovered that I can use relative
paths for the directories in its <tt>quadpres.ini</tt> file.). Other than
that I created a <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?query=bundle-zavitan&mode=all">Bundle::Zavitan</a> bundle on CPAN to install all the modules needed
by the seminars management project.


<p> <p><b>Haifux Meeting</b>

<p> <p>
On Monday, Shachar Shemesh gave an entertaining talk about 
<a href="http://www.winehq.org/">WINE</a>. There were a few glitches during
the demonstrations, but they were expected. It was fun meeting all the
people again.


<p> <p><b>Reading</b>

<p> <p>
In the SVG Programming Book, I finished everything up to the chapter about
SVG animations. I covered all the static SVG stuff, and am now starting
to read the dynamic SVG functionality.
