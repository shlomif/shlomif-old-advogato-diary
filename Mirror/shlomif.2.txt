Last night there wasn't any episode of "The Gilmore Girls"
due to some special about Shlomo Artzi. I was looking
forward to it, so I was a little frustrated. Tonight, I
had a standard Sitcom + "Whose Line is it Anyway" marathon.

But back to my open-source activities. I worked on the R2L
KDE Applet a bit. The code looks better, but still needs
some work.

Besides that, I managed to get Hebrew LaTeX to work, but I
still don't know how to edit it properly with logical BiDi
view. Maybe someone will eventually enlighten me about
this. I could work on porting gtkbidi to the newest
version of Gtk+ 1.2.x. Or I could work on LaTeX on
Windows...
