<p><b>Fixing the IP-Noise Final Report</b>

<p> <p>
The Final Report of the IP-Noise Project which Roy and I 
wrote was based on an old version of the Mid-Term Report
before Lavy fixed a lot of things. Thus, Lavy was not 
very happy with it, and asked us to correct things before
he'll take another look. He said the user's guide which
we wrote was very good, OTOH.

Today, my father and I went over the final report and 
corrected a lot of things.  Office XP was installed so it 
can read the report in the first place, but it still 
causes some minor glitches. But so far, the document is 
better than it was before.

The worst case scenario is that we will lose some points 
due to the brevity of the report.
