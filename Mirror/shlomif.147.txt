<p><b>Browsers Incompatiblity</b>

<p> <p>
While working on the Perl Beginners site, I discovered an incompatibility
between MSIE and Mozilla and between Opera and Konqueror. Apparently, when
specifying <tt>"background : none"</tt> in the CSS stylesheet, Mozilla makes
the background transparent, while Konqueror and Opera only modify the
background-image if existent. After I changed it to 
<tt>"background-color : transparent"</tt> it resolved itself in both
browsers (and still displayed fine in the others).

<p> <p><b>Haifux Meeting</b>

<p> <p>
Eli Billauer gave a nice lecture about IP Masquerading using IP-Tables this
Monday. I met Orna there, and gave her some money to join the Hamakor Amuta. 
(Muli confirmed he received the money from her, and will pass it to the
NPO's treasurer). I also met someone who started using Linux not long ago,
and asked on GNUbies-IL what can we recommend as a Linux replacement for
Front Page or Dreamweaver. I asked him what exactly he would like to do,
and only then replied. In the meeting he said that "if I ask you to recommend 
a car, you should not ask me 'What kind of car do you want?'". I told
him there were many kind of cars... In any case, I told him a little about
the HTML writing tools and we had a nice discussion.


<p> <p><b>Studies</b>

<p> <p>
I met with my partner yesterday to prepare the Micro-computers exercise
and we finished it in a couple of hours. Yesterday I also had to give in
the Mamat exercise, which forced me to stay a bit late to print it, because
the printer in the UNIX farm had a problem. We still have some time left to 
prepare the Financial Management one, and I'll probably sit with my 
"Software Systems" partner on the weekend for the project.

Yesterday I studied in Micro about the FPU and MMX instructions of the Pentium
processor. It was quite interesting.
