<p><b>Hacktivity</b>

<p> <p>
I left's Graham function alone today... ;-) Instead I began with some work on
Quad-Pres (my presentation tool) which involved some minor cleanups. After
breakfast, I discovered it started to rain so I could not go out to bike
today. Instead, I spent some time working on a <a href="http://cvs.berlios.de/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/haifux/haifux/lectures_man/">lecture management system</a>
for the Haifa Linux Club Home-Site.


<p> <p>
As of today, the situation is, that every lecture has to be placed and
maintained in several pages. I wrote a Perl script and module that will render
everything based on a set of tables that are updated at one place. Here's what
sloccount has to say about it:


<p> <p>
<pre>
SLOC    Directory       SLOC-by-Language (Sorted)
1008    top_dir         perl=1008
0       CVS             (none)
0       dest            (none)


<p> Totals grouped by language (dominant language first):
perl:          1008 (100.00%)




<p> Total Physical Source Lines of Code (SLOC)                = 1,008
Development Effort Estimate, Person-Years (Person-Months) = 0.20 (2.42)
 (Basic COCOMO model, Person-Months = 2.4 * (KSLOC**1.05))
Schedule Estimate, Years (Months)                         = 0.29 (3.50)
 (Basic COCOMO model, Months = 2.5 * (person-months**0.38))
Estimated Average Number of Developers (Effort/Schedule)  = 0.69
Total Estimated Cost to Develop                           = $ 27,244
 (average salary = $56,286/year, overhead = 2.40).

<p> <p>
2.42 person-months of effort concentrated in a day...


<p> <p>
Afterwards, I spent the late afternoon, vainly trying to re-design the
<a href="http://syscalltrack.sf.net/">Syscalltrack Homepage</a> the
way I want it while using only &lt;div&gt;'s and CSS 2 for layout. If I
had been able to use table tags, I would have finished it in no time. After
I visited the #html channel on EF-Net I found a site that accomplishes what
I wanted to do, but was not able to fully duplicate its functionality. I'll try again later tomorrow, or simply fall back on tables.


<p> <p><b>Reading</b>

<p> <p>
I made some progress with "Programming Perl", reading part of the chapter
about Objects. By reading it, I become familiar with a lot of new tricks
and new Perl nuances.
