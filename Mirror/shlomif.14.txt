<b>Freecell Solver</b>


<p> <p>
I released version 2.0.0 of it. There are two very big
things which I'd like to do with it now: add support for
multiple threads to operate on the same states' collection,
and port to Java. I'll do the former first, so I'll have a
good code-base to translate into Java.


<p> <p>
Otherwise than that, I'm also thinking of finding a way to
abstract prunes without messing the code too much. But since
Freecell Solver is fast enough as it is, it's in a rather
low priority.

I coded such a beast for POSIX threads and you can find it
<a href="http://vipe.technion.ac.il/~shlomif/rwlock/">here</a>.
I did it mainly for fun and to see if the model I thought
about for implementing it would work. It seems that it does.


<p> <p>
I received some feedback about it from various people. Now I
have an idea for improving it, so there will be a smaller
number of condition variables that are allocated. But I'll
release the current implementation as 0.2 before I do that.


<p> <p>
Unfortunately, I'm not going to use such a mechanism for
Freecell Solver's multi-threading capabilities. The reason
is that the atomic operation of managing the states
collection is of checking if a state exists and if not
adding it. (and returning whether it was the case). That
way, a mutex is enough.

I added an incomplete scene called "The Street". It has a
lot to do with Computer Science, so I recommend hackers to
<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/hackers-il/message/1581">
read it</a>.

After having to do 5 exercises in "Structure and
Interpretation of Computer Programs", I won't be surprised
if I'll start dreaming in parenthesis. During the last
lecture, I managed to correct the lecturer on one occasion.
Read about it
<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/hackers-il/message/1594">
in this post I made to Hackers-IL</a>.

In case, I did not mention it here earlier, I'm writing the
answers in English and using LaTeX. It's very convenient and
causes much less trouble and frustration than Word. I
discovered that one should write {\tt My text} instead of
\tt{My text}. LaTeX is not without its idiosyncrecies, but
at least one becomes familiar with them eventually, which is
not the case with MS-Word.


<p> <p>
Other than that, I stopped studying "Digital
Communications". The lecturer and the T.A. were great and
the material was very interesting, but the homework took too
much time. And after I worked in the summer on the project,
I'd like to have a light semester.
