<p><b>Rindolf</b>

<p> <p>
Omer Zak convinced to write a detailed SPEC of Rindolf, so
people will understand what's my general direction is. You
can find it <a
href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/rindolf-discuss/files/Specs/0.2.x/rindolf-spec.html">here</a>.
So far, it diverted a bit from my original intention as I
decided to not make it break compatibility. What I am going
to do, though, is deprecate a lot of stuff by let issuing
warning s all over the place.


<p> <p>
I also issued an informal ad-hoc <a
href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/rindolf-discuss/message/61">
Road Plan</a> to the project. It does not include
implementing anything yet, but then again a good design is a
pre-requisite for starting to through code all over the
place. And naturally the behaviour of the program has to be
designed before the actual design of the internals.
