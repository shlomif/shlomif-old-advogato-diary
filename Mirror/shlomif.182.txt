<p><b>Quad-Pres</b>

<p> <p> <p>
More Hacking. More tests, and finally a new stable version release. I branched
and tagged version 0.10.0 only to discover I did not update the file list of
the tests directory, so I released version 0.10.1 as well.


<p> <p> <p>
It seems Quad-Pres has disappeared from Freshmeat, possibly because vipe was
down for a while. (I did not receive an E-mail about it, though). Eventually,
I registered a project at BerliOS, and now it has <a href="http://quad-pres.berlios.de">a new homepage</a>. So, now Freshmeat points at it and hopefully it 
would be safer there.


<p> <p> <p><b>Version Control Systems</b>

<p> <p> <p>
Added a few items and corrected some typos in the version control comparison.
Also, I recommended Subversion in a recent discussion in webdesign-l, and 
someone posted a message that when he tried to install Subversion on Win32,
it did not work for him.


<p> <p> <p>
To help him and others in the future, I installed Subversion myself on my
Windows XP laptop, and documented the process. Et voila: 
<a href="http://better-scm.berlios.de/subversion/Subversion-Win32-Installation-Guide.txt">a 
    Subversion Win32 Installation Walkthrough</a>. Share and enjoy!


<p> <p> <p><b>Translation</b>

<p> <p> <p>
I'm taking a break from translating "Homesteading the Noosphere" by translating
the Joel on Software <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000348.html">"Rub a Dub Dub"</a> article (to Hebrew, of course. Like I know any
other language besides that and English well enough.) Here's the 
<a href="http://t2.technion.ac.il/~shlomif/rub-a-dub/">site 
    where I'll put intermediate copies of the translation.</a>


<p> <p> <p>
Finally, I went over the slides of the GIMP Lecture in preparation for my
lecture on Sunday. And on Monday there's a Haifux Welcome to Linux coordination
meeting.
