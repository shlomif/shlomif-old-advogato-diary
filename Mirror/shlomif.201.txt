<p><b>Life + Studies</b>

<p> <p> <p>
I had been sick starting a week ago, but now I'm OK. Meanwhile I missed
the Statistics Monday, so I had a gap of several lessons which I did not
learn, and could not hand in the three assignments. I E-mailed the T.A.
asking when to hand them, and she told me to hand them on Wednesday. (which
came right before my Thermodynamics lecture).

<p> <p>
On Wednesday I felt better, and took a ride to the Technion. I found her
room and waited for her there a long time, but the door was closed and she
was nowhere to be seen. I came to the room two other times throughout the day,
but she wasn't there then, either.

<p> <p>
She eventually E-mailed me that she had an urgent meeting and could not come
to her reception hours that day, and so I should hand in my assignment at
the class on Monday (two days from now). I also need to hand in another
assignment then, but I don't know how to solve one of the questions because
it covers material that I did not learn yet. Whatever, I solved the other
question.

<p> <p>
At Wednesday I also photo-copied the Thermo lecture that took place at the
hall without proper tables to write on, so I won't need to go through
understanding my bad writing being even worse.


<p> <p> <p><b>The Eternal Jew</b>

<p> <p> <p>
I might as well tell that the philosophical essay I worked on is
<a href="http://t2.technion.ac.il/~shlomif/philosophy/the-eternal-jew/">The
    Eternal Jew</a>. It is complete now, and I sent it to several people
for review, but none have responded yet. If you wish, you can read it
and comment.


<p> <p> <p><b>WWW::Form</b>

<p> <p> <p>
I added a lot of tests to it, and fixed another bug (while writing a test
to it, first). Ben promised he will release a new version of CPAN based on
what we have in the repository now, when he finds some spare cycles. (he
is very busy in work, now) We'll probably continue covering more and more
of the functionality in tests, and when the tests coverage is reasonable,
we'll start adding more features.


<p> <p> <p>
We've talked with instant messaging about some stuff, including error handling,
and adding common controls (like country-list, U.S. states' list) to be
auto-generated, as well as creating a function inside <tt>_setFields</tt> to
set one field.


<p> <p> <p><b>Review of Perl &amp; XML</b>

<p> <p> <p>
I finished reading Perl &amp; XML and wrote <a href="http://www.perl.org.il/kwiki/index.cgi?BookReviewPerlAndXmlByShlomif">a review of it</a>. This means
I now wrote the 10 last book reviews of the Israeli Perl mongers.


<p> <p> <p><b>Quad-Pres Logo</b>

<p> <p> <p>
I've been working on <a href="http://stalker.iguide.co.il:8080/svn/lm-solve/quad-pres-logo/">a logo for Quad-Pres using the GIMP</a>. I started by
constructing a wireframe text saying "Quad-Pres". I finished the Q and the
u by now, but they are not perfect. Maybe I just need to look harder for a
suitable font. I think I'll install "Print Shop Ensemble III" as it comes
with plenty of fonts.


<p> <p> <p><b>GIMP Bug Squashing</b>

<p> <p> <p>
I spent some time tracing and fixing some bugs that had to do with the
GIMP Image Info Window. You can find the patches and discussion
in <a href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=118084">Bug
    #118084</a> and
<a href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=132329">Bug
    #132329</a>.


<p> <p> <p><b>Spam</b>

<p> <p> <p>
Despite the fact that my SpamAssassin installation is up-to-date, a lot
of Spam on Vipe still slipped through. So I decided to enable its Bayesian
filtering. I invoked "sa-learn" with my ham and gradually had more and more
spam to put there. Now it seems to be working better and better.


<p> <p> <p>
I don't have a spam filter on my home E-mail, but I may eventually. To prepare
for this, I started collecting all my spam, so I'll later can input it into
the Bayesian filtering. I wonder if SpamAssassin can easily work with kmail,
because it's very nice.


<p> <p> <p>
Otherwise I discovered my ISP's SMTP server is on the black-lists of several
other SMTP servers. I still don't know if it's really an open relay or not.


<p> <p> <p><b>MySQL Client Library</b>

<p> <p> <p>
The MySQL client library for versions 3.x of the product was LGPLed, and for
versions 4.x it is GPLed, which does not allow proprietary applications to
link against it, without purchasing a license. So, I decided to compare them
to see how different they are and if the old one could be forward-ported to
the other.


<p> <p> <p>
It turns out to be a 2,764-lines patch, that most of it are whitespace-changes,
and can easily be manually applied to the older source, in a few days of work.
Generally, I disapprove of using the GPL in hope of getting more revenue this
way when LGPLed original is available, and the library does not have something
substantial to offer. So I think I'll forward-port the MySQL library.
