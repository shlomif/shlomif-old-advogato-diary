<p><b>Telux Meeting</b>

<p> <p>
We had a Tel Aviv Linux Club meeting the Sunday before the last on the 
"Open Source development
model and how non-programmers can contribute" given by Ori Idan and Shoshanah
Forbes. The lecture was very nice and was finished quite early which gave 
us a lot of time to chat. (I was also able to return buying a soda to someone
whom I lended money for a soda can from). Can't recall exactly what I talked
about but it was fun.


<p> <p><b>YAPC::Israel::2004</b>

<p> <p>
I've been to 
<a href="http://www.perl.org.il/YAPC/2004/">YAPC::Israel::2004</a> 
some time ago. I woke up early in the morning to catch my ride with Thomas 
Maier. We drove to Central Tel Aviv to pick up Ran Eilam. Ran was a little
late, but he arrived at the end. Then we drove to the Interdisciplinary Center
in Herzliya, where we got to the designated location. There we helped prepare
the bags for the participants, and their tags. It took quite a while, but was
quite fun.


<p> <p>
Then came the introducory talks and the lightning talks. I enjoyed them a lot, 
and one of them was my own that went very well. Next came the longer 
presentations. Ran Eilam's presentation about the Aspect module was very nice,
and introduced some Aspect-oriented-programming voodoo. Marth Greenberg's 
"System Monitoring with Perl" was quite informative and interesting.


<p> <p>
Next I attended Yuval Kogman's "Making your objects smell funny" presentation
where he introduced some cool AUTOLOAD tricks. Afterwards I had to give my
presentation about the LM-Solve module, but there was very little attendance
in the hall. (3 people to be exact) I gave it anyway and finished up in due 
half the time, and was still able to catch half of Dov Grobgeld's presentation
about the Perl/Gtk2 module. (I felt that my own presentation did not go too 
well).


<p> <p>
Afterwards I attended Mikhael Goikhman's "Artificial Intelligence and Perl"
which was a bit tedious. Then came the book giveaway's in which I was given a 
book about qmail as a present.


<p> <p>
Then came the Speakers' Dinners and BOFs. It was at the Seven Stars Mall, in
a coffee shop called English cake. There was a show for children nearby and all
in all I did not feel very well. I called my father to pick me up from there.
While he took the time to arrive, I went to the key-signing. The problem was
that I was the only one who brought my key fingerprint from home and no-one 
else seemed to do so. So I figure out that I'm not going to sign the keys of
the other people. :-(


<p> <p><b>Disk on Key</b>

<p> <p>
My father upgraded his USB disk-on-key and gave me his old one. So I tried
to get it to work with Linux. After trying to figure out why the 
appropriate SCSI disk could not be mounted with a simple mount command despite
the fact it was present in the SCSI listing under /proc, I finally realized
I did not have the SCSI disk module compiled. After compiling it in the
kernel 2.6.x tree and installing it, the problem was resolved.


<p> <p>
I was able to mount the disk and place files on it and everything now works.
Hallelujah!


<p> <p><b>Sodipodi's Font Problem</b>

<p> <p>
Sodipodi had a problem that whenever text was typed, or the font dialog
invoked, it would crash. It started happening only after I installed a large
number of fonts. I reported the bug to their mailing list, but it did not 
get me very far. After a long while, I discovered that inkscape, which is a 
Sodipodi fork did not have this problem. Then I read an E-mail in its mailing
list that said that someone else had this problem and fixed it.


<p> <p>
The patch he supplied in the problem report fixed the problem for me as well,
and Lauris Kaplinsky (the Sodipodi developer) applied it to the CVS version.
All's well that ends well.


<p> <p><b>Gobliiins on Dosbox</b>

<p> <p>
I'm now playing Gobliiins on Dosbox - it's a lot of fun, and I'm making a lot
of progress.


<p> <p><b>New Wiki for Perl-Begin</b>

<p> <p>
Having been displeased with Chiq-Chaq for the wiki implementation, I've
been looking for a different wiki. I've tried installing TWiki, but its 
installation could not be carried out by a mere mortal, especially if I
don't have root. PerlJam on FreeNode's #perl suggested
<a href="http://www.pmichaud.com/wiki/PmWiki/PmWiki">PmWiki</a>. I've tried
it out and found very easy to install and with a nice syntax.


<p> <p>
So, I set it up on BerliOS, and converted all the old content to the
<a href="http://perl-begin.berlios.de/Wiki/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomePage">new 
    wiki</a> (in one evening), and now the new wiki is set up and filled with
the original content.
