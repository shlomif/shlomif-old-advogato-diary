<p><b>Savannah and Subversion Efforts</b>

<p> <p> <p> <p>
You can check out my efforts to get Savannah to have
public Subversion hosting <a href="http://mail.gnu.org/pipermail/savannah-hackers/2002-November/013359.html">here</a> and <a href="http://mail.gnu.org/pipermail/savannah-hackers/2002-November/013427.html">here</a>. I'll let you be the judge for yourself. It seems they are more likely to get Arch and Aegis hosting which is better than nothing, but Subversion still appeals more to people
who are used to CVS and BitKeeper.


<p> <p> <b>Homepage Revamp</b>

<p> <p>
I started revamping <a href="http://t2.technion.ac.il/~shlomif/">my homepage</a>, gradually converting web-pages to WebMetaLanguage and a common CSS stylesheet. Some of the pages are still in plain, not very standards compliant HTML, but I'm getting there.


<p> <p> <b>MSIE Fork Bomb</b>

<p> <p> 
Last Haifux W2L session (where Guy gave a nice lecture about development tools), Alon demonstrated how a server
sends a simple text file (with HMTL tags) that Internet
Explorer thinks is an HTML file, and starts opening an 
infinite number of Windows. It does not happen with other 
browsers who correctly identify the Content-Type header.


<p> <p> 
We also mentioned that the Students Association in the Technion site sends an HTML page without a "Content-Type: text/html" header, and so only IE can view it.

<p> <p><b>Freecell Solver Arch Doc</b>

<p> <p>
<a href="http://cvs.berlios.de/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/fc-solve/fc-solve/arch_doc/summary/">
This CVS directory</a> now contains several text files with summaries of things I'll put in the architecture document. They are still work in progress.
