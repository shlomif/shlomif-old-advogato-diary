<p><b>Article at Perl.com</b>

<p> <p>
<a href="http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2003/11/17/lmsolve.html">An
Article I wrote to Perl.com</a> was published yesterday. The article covers solving some types of puzzles with the
<a href="http://vipe.technion.ac.il/~shlomif/lm-solve/">LM-Solve</a>
framework. (which I authored). I did not mention I originally wrote it (which was some months ago) here because I did not want to ruin the element of surprise. I'd like to take the forum and thank two correpondants from <a href="http://www.perl.org.il/">Perl-IL</a> who
commented on an early draft of the article, and for
<a href="/person/Simon/">Simon</a>, the Perl.com editor, for instructing me how to do a thorough revamp of it, and for
publishing it.


<p> <p>
Maybe I should take the opportunity to clarify my opinion on Perl.com, because some people who read <a href="http://fc-solve.berlios.de/perl-att-newbies/perl-newbies/book1.html">
the "usabilty" of the Perl Online World for Newcomers</a>
misinterpreted it. I don't have a problem with perl.com <b>as a site</b>. It's a nice site, with interesting articles. I do have a problem that it is considered the homepage of Perl, because it is very much inappropriate for it. Recently, <a href="http://www.perl.org/">www.perl.org</a> got a facelife, and regardless of its shortcomings, is already more suitable as a homepage for the Perl culture. So I suggest people to link to that as Perl and not to Perl.com.
