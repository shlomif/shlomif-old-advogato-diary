<p><b>Work on W2L</b>

<p> <p>
I did a lot of Work on the Israeli "Welcome to Linux" online resources. I
set up <a href="http://welcome.linux.org.il/">site for it</a>, tweaked the
registration form. I also had to set up an E-mail domain using the 
eskimo.iglu.org.il qmail. I also helped a bit with revising the TeX 
documents from last year. Working on the sites was a lot of work, but I hope
it was worth it.


<p> <p><b>Getting CPANPLUS to Send Mail</b>

<p> <p>
Following Gabor Szabo's presentation in the last Israel.PM meeting, I decided 
to become <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/CPANPLUS/bin/cpansmoke">a CPAN 
    Smoke Tester</a>. So I set up a non-privileged account for this, and
installed perl and the CPANPLUS module there. Then I had to set it up to 
send mail. Reading the docs of the modules, I found it that they could either
send mail by using SMTP (which was more limited) or by using the sendmail or
equivalent program. So I had to set up the sendmail replacement to work on my 
system.


<p> <p>
This involved setting up Postfix on my system. I enabled it and started reading
the docs to see how to configure it. It was able to send several messages to
various places eventually. However, while it actually sent a message via SMTP
to the cpan-testers mailing list, none of them have arrived there.


<p> <p>
The Ethereal dump said something like this:


<p> <pre>
MAIL FROM:&lt;cpan@localhost.localdomain&gt; SIZE=2444
RCPT TO:&lt;cpan-testers@perl.org&gt;
DATA
</pre>

<p> <p>
Which contained cpan@localhost.localdomain in the MAIL FROM: instead of my
real mail address. I tried to configure postfix to use the correct MAIL FROM,
but to no avail. Then a simple Google search for "mandrake postfix" yielded
<a href="http://rpgoldman.real-time.com/linux/postfix-linux.html">this 
    document about configuring Postfix</a> as the first result. This explained
everything I needed to do, and afterwards it worked.


<p> <p>
Meanwhile I wasted several hours in what could have been resolved with a simple
Google search.


<p> <p><b>Bug Reporting Spree</b>

<p> <p>
I took two days to go on a bug reporting spree. There were a few bugs I 
collected in <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/bugs/SUMMARY/">a bug list</a>,
and I reported them. There are still some bugs I haven't reported yet. 


<p> <p><b>Blisters</b>

<p> <p>
I used to have blisters on my feet. It was quite unpleasant. Most of them
are gone now, after my mom and I took care of them.


<p> <p><b>Perl 6 Critique Article</b>

<p> <p>
I published <a href="http://freshmeat.net/articles/view/1339/">a Perl 6 
    Critique Article in Freshmeat</a>. You can also find disucssions of it
<a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.advocacy/2153">in the

<p>     perl-advocacy mailing list</a>, 
<a href="http://linmagazine.co.il/node/view/4478">in linmagazine</a> (in
Hebrew), and 
<a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=399745">in Perlmonks</a>.


<p> <p><b>JLC Site</b>

<p> <p>
I did some work and created <a href="http://jlc.iglu.org.il/">a new and 
    improved site for the Jerusalem Linux Club</a>. It still lacks information
about the Welcome to Linux series, and also Hebrew content.


<p> <p>
There's also <a href="http://jlc.shared.mirimar.net/">another site that 
    someone created</a>, but I'm quite unhappy with it.


<p> <p><b>Mandrake</b>

<p> <p>
There weren't any updates for the Mandrake 10.1 Community Edition from 
15-September to more than a month later. When the updates did come out, the
hdlist.cz file (that concentrates the information about the packages) was 
faulty. Eventually, the official edition came out, but they were delays
in getting it.


<p> <p>
Now, I'm on Official Edition, and everything is OK, but there was a long time
when my system was out-of-date.


<p> <p><b>The Digital Camera and Linux</b>

<p> <p>
My family has a digital camera. I tried to get it to work with Linux. It uses
some memory cards and we have a memory card reader for this that connects
to the computer via USB. So I connected it to the computer when it ran Linux 
and tried to read it.

<p>
The USB device was detected in <tt>/proc/bus/usb/devices</tt> and appeared
in the output of <tt>cdrecord -scanbus</tt>, but I was not able to mount it
no matter what I tried. Eventually, I found out that I had to mount 
<tt>/dev/sdc1</tt> instead of <tt>/dev/sdc</tt>. Afterwards it worked 
perfectly.


<p> <p><b>First W2L Meeting in Telux</b>

<p> <p>
The first W2L Meeting in Telux took place yesterday. Many people arrived and
the room was packed. Eddie gave a nice "Blitz" lecture, and many questions
were asked and answered. The main problem was that it lasted for a long time - 
over 2 hours.
