<p><b>Gilbo'a March</b>

<p> <p>
The Saturday before the last, my father and I attended the Gilbo'a March. He
wook me up early, we drove and there and took the short 6 km route. Dad came 
there with sandals and kept getting stones into his shoes. He also slowed me 
down quite a bit, and I had to wait for him a lot. As far as food was 
concerned, I ate a few apples, a snack, and a hot dog after the March. I don't
remember my father eating anything at all.

Anyway, we had a good time. The scenery was beautiful and it was fun walking
outdoors. I took the book "The qmail Handbook" with me for the ride and read 
it on the way there and back.


<p> <p><b>Random Computer Problems</b>

<p> <p>
When trying to use KAddressbook, I noticed that my distribution lists 
disappeared. Turns out it was a change of format, which I had to fix manually.
Berkeley dbxml caused me more problems, with some obscure exceptions being
thrown by the C++ code. After contacting a support person of Sleepy Cat, I 
found out it happened because I was using Xerces-C 2.5.x instead of 2.4.x. 
Downgrading Xerces-C solved this problem.

When upgrading some of my Mandrake packages, I noticed that upon invocation of 
some scanner-related code, the process started to consume all CPU and print 
some kind of message. This even happened during boot time sometimes. I filed 
<a href="http://qa.mandrakesoft.com/show_bug.cgi?id=9297">a bug report</a>
and found out that the problem can be solved by replacing the faulty 
sane-backends package with its older version (of the Mandrake release). I did
it and now everything works fine.

When trying to help Eran, I tried to install the ADSL connectivity as a 
PPPoE straight to the computer, without the router in between. I was
not successful, and eventually, decided to revert it. Upon boot, my networking
was left in a sub-optimal state: there wasn't a /sbin/route route to the 
Internet and the eth0 Ethernet card was enabled. After a lot of head-scratching
, I was able to solve the problem by removing the S11internet startup script.
This is a script that starts the Internet connectivity, was enabled by
the Mandrake control center, and was kept there, after I tried to revert
the problem.


<p> <p>
I tried to use drakfont to uninstall several fonts using the command line
<tt>--uninstall</tt> and it did not work. Nothing happened. I filed 
<a href="http://qa.mandrakesoft.com/show_bug.cgi?id=9324">a bug
    report to it</a> and eventually was able to fix it with a small
patch that took me quite a long time to write. (also available at the 
bug report).


<p> <p>
rpmdrake and MandrakeUpdate converted to using gtk2, so now the buttons
are in different locations in the message boxes. Thanks to the GNOME HIG 
(= Horrible Interface Guidelines), I pressed the wrong buttons, but now
I simply have to take the time to think for a while about that. Wretched
GNOME developers.


<p> <p>
I had a problem with Yahoogrooups that I was a member of a mailing list
, but could not access the web files. I tried many things, but they
did not work. After reading the usage instructions, I was able to be
registered to the web services.


<p> <p>
Finally, now that I'm using KHTML 3.2.x it seems there are some new
bugs in it. For example, <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/magic-cauldron/">DocBook TOC's are displayed with vertical spaces</a>
and a <a href="http://use.perl.org/~gabor/journal/">use.perl.org journal
    is not displayed correctly</a>. Hopefully, I'll find some time to 
isolate these problems and report them to the KDE bugzilla. Will wonders ever 
cease?


<p> <p><b>Studies</b>

<p> <p>
I took the two second chance tests - in "Introduction to Thermodyanmics
and Statistical Physics" and in "Statistics". I did not felt very confident
about the Thermodynamics test (it was pretty hard), but eventually I got
a final score of 78%. (Yay!)


<p> <p>
The Statistics test did not go too well. There were many difficult
questions there and several things that I did not know how to answer. I'll
wait for the grade and see how I fare.


<p> <p><b>MLDonkey</b>

<p> <p>
A couple of days ago, I downloaded a song at a speed of 40 KBps during its
entire download. It was finished in a second, and it was not corrupted!
