<p><b>Version Control Systems Overview Article</b>

<p> <p> <p>
<a href="http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2004/01/29/scm_overview.html">An
    article that I wrote with an overview of Version Control Systems</a>
got published on O'Reilly's ONLamp.com. I wrote a suggestions to it (with a
summary, IIRC) to the editors of O'ReillyNet some monthes ago. 
<a href="/person/chromatic/">chromatic</a> answered me, said he would publish it and asked me
to write a draft. I wrote a draft and sent it to a couple of people I know
from the version control business, and they helped me revise and correct it.
Tom Lord of Arch fame was especially helpful with his commentary, but I 
received a lot of useful commentary from other people.


<p> <p> <p>
The published article is not identical to the final draft I have. Some things 
were clearly modified, and I believe that it detracted a lot from the article's
colour. But whatever. 


<p> <p> <p><b>Studies</b>

<p> <p> <p>
I have no more lectures and tutorials for this semester. My first test is 
in two weeks, and the next one a few days afterwards, which gives me some time
to study. I have a lot of material to cover as far as Thermodynamics is 
concerned, and also need to prepare some material summary pages for 
Statistics. (and naturally need to prepare for that too)


<p> <p> <p><b>Work on WWW::Form</b>

<p> <p> <p>
It turns out we forgot to include the README in the MANIFEST of WWW::Form 1.13.
I fixed it along with a test to make sure it won't be neglected. Now, the 
question is what will make sure the test file will be included there. (Who will
watch the watcher?).


<p> <p> <p>
I also did some refactoring of the code. The original code had a function to
set all the fields parameters as inputted from the user. I converted it to
one small loop that calls a function that sets each parameter individually. 
I thought that was enough to add new parameters for every form field, but then
thought of a better idea, and so created a function to return them as a hash.


<p> <p> <p>
Now, the user can sub-class this method alone, call the original and add more
parameters of his own to the hash reference that is returned.


<p> <p> <p>
I'm doing test-driven development now, writing tests before writing the code.


<p> <p> <p><b>Hebrew XML with Perl</b>

<p> <p> <p>
I wrote <a href="http://www.iglu.org.il/shlomif/hebrew-xml-in-perl/hebrew-xml-in-perl.html">an article about processing Hebrew with Perl</a> (it's in Hebrew).
I received <a href="http://www.perl.org.il/pipermail/perl/2004-January/003961.html">some useful commentary on it</a> and revised it accordingly. Now I hope
it will be published in the <a href="http://code.semuel.co.il/perl/index.html">Perl 
    and Hebrew page</a>.


<p> <p> <p><b>PCLinuxOS Live CD</b>

<p> <p> <p>
I downloaded the PCLinuxOS LiveCD which is a Mandrake-based Linux Live CD. The
first burning produced a CD that booted but got stuck with some errors in the
middle of the initialization. It was probably because I did too many things
at once. So I re-verified the MD5 sum and did another copy. This time it worked
perfectly.


<p> <p> <p>
Well, I only played with it a little. I found out it did not have gvim, or joe,
(guess that if you want to have both GNOME and KDE, you have to give up 
something), and so it wasn't ideal as a rescue CD. Still, it seems nice. 
Probably a nice way to introduce Linux for newbies, or install Mandrake for 
them.


<p> <p> <p><b>GIMP</b>

<p> <p> <p>
I stambled across <a href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=132356">a
    bug in the GIMP Curves dialog</a> when I was looking for interesting
GIMP bugs to solve. So, I tried to reproduce it on my system, but could not.
One thing I was able to do, even with fewer clicks than were described was
in the bug report, is to grab the pointer for the window with a few rapid
clicks.  It is so bad, I have to kill the GIMP to release it.


<p> <p> <p>
However, Sven Neumann could not reproduce it on his machine, and he claims
it is a problem in my X server. I tried to disable the Nvidia acceleration,
but this did not help either. Even a bug fix from Sven to disable the 
explicit pointer grab did not help. What could be the problem?


<p> <p> <p><b>DocBook</b>

<p> <p> <p>
I ended up using the XSL stylesheets of DocBook for processing "The
Eternal Jew" into XHTML. They are quite nice and I was able to customize
them to include a CSS stylesheet and other stuff. Now, I'm stuck as I want
to make sure a specific <tt>itemizedlist</tt> will be CSS-classed according
to its role attribute. This turned out to require a hairy XSL customization,
and I guess I'll have to learn XSLT better to do it by myself.
