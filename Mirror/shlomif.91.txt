<p><b>New Monitor</b>

<p> <p>
Dad ordered a new monitor (a MAG Innovision 786 FD) and
it arrived a couple of days ago. He installed it, and now windows and Linux plays nice with it. It is not as dark as the old monitor (so I can see the fine details in them Propaganda pictures), and the separation of pixels is much better. Hoorah!


<p> <p><b>My Aunt's Wedding</b>

<p> <p>
My Aunt got married the second time yesterday's evening. My family and I travelled north, attended the wedding, and stayed in a hostel this evening. In the morning we ate breakfast and came to see her (and some of our other family) again. Now we're back home.


<p> <p>
The trip was nice, but it confused the order of the days for all of us. I kept feeling that yesterday was Friday and my mother felt that today was a Saturday. :-)


<p> <p><b>Struggling with Autoconf and Makefile.PL</b>

<p> <p>
For I-Bex, I need to install some data files, and figured out the easiest way to do this was to write an Autoconf script that calls Makefile.PL for one of its sub-dirs, like the GIMP. However, I cannot seem to make "make dist" to work right, and just discovered it does not work right for gimp-1.2.3, either. (Shoot!)


<p> <p>
Apparently, the make dist of the Makefile generated by Makefile.PL does not accept the Autoconf magic macros.

If anyone here got it to work, please E-mail me.
