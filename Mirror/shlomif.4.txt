I finally borrowed the book "Computation Structures" from
the Technion's library and refreshed my memory about the
MAYBE architecture. I woke up last night at 1 AM (it's so
hot now and I don't have Air-Conditioning) so I decided to
write a description of the maybe to the Haifux' projects'
list. I posted it, but the whole archive has yet to
appear in mail-archive.com.

I learned the <a href="http://www.engelschall.com/sw/wml/">
Web Meta Language</a> (or WML for short) today. I'd like
to use it for the <a
href="http://comnet.technion.ac.il/~cn1w02/">
IP-Noise project's site</a> and if I see that it is handy
enough, for other things like "DeCSS for JavaScript" or
the  new GIMP's homepage. But, at the moment, the web-site
of the project does not look too good, so I have an
incenitive to do it first.

But now it's 10 PM and yesterday I did not sleep too well
, so I'd like to get some sleep now.
