<p><b>Studies</b>

<p> <p>
On Saturday my partner for Software Systems and I sat on the fourth exercise
and the project and finished them (hoorah!). On Sunday, I worked on the
Micro-computers exercise. I had to emulate the Pentium Processor's Segmentation
and Paging mechanisms in software, but it wasn't hard. Still, I have no way
of knowing if what I did was correct, because they didn't supply any test
data.


<p> <p>
Today, I sat with my partner on "Intro to Software Systems" and we finished
the fifth exercise. That's it, I guess.


<p> <p><b>Hacktivity</b>

<p> <p>
I began to implement support for Hexagonal
<a href="http://www.clickmazes.com/planks/ixplanks.htm">Planks in the
Swamp Puzzles</a> into LM-Solve. After I was through, I tested it on
one of the boards, and it wouldn't solve after a complete scan. To find
out where the problem was, I decided to code a pseudo-implementation of
the plank puzzles, which would tell me what is the first state that the
solver did not reach. I wrote it in Perl/Tk on Friday, and using it
was able to find the bug. The problem was that a plank could have been
set on a place that would cross its new position. So, it had to be excluded
from the test.


<p> <p>
Other than that I continued to work on Chiq-Chaq's HTML Validation.


<p> <p><b>Israel.PM Meeting</b>

<p> <p>
The meeting went well and the lectures were very interesting. I returned
Damian Conway's "Object Oriented Perl" and took home the book
"Win32 Perl Programming". I met there someone who told me he learned Perl
from my <a href="http://vipe.technion.ac.il/~shlomif/lecture/Perl/Newbies/">
Perl for Newbies lectures</a>. Here's <a href="http://www.perl.org.il/20030612.html">More information about the meeting</a>.


<p> <p><b>Reading</b>

<p> <p>
I finished Damian Conway's "Object Oriented Perl", and am halfway through
on "SVG Programming: The Graphical Web" by Kurt Cagle. Nothing more to add.


<p> <p><b>Hard-disk Games</b>

<p> <p>
My hard-disk started making a lot of weird noises again lately. I remembered
the root partition was faulty, and sought a way to overcome it. I eventually
made my /home partition the root, transferred all existing sub-dirs under /home
there, and re-installed Mandrake there. Works like a charm.

<p>
I ran badblocks on the old partition, and it could not detect any error.
Also, all the old file operations that caused problems are no longer
problematic. Weird.
