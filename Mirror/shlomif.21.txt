So many things happened since my last diary entry and I have
so many things to
write. Well - better start somewhere - here goes:


<p> <p><b>"The Great Kernel CVS Mutiny"</b>

<p> <p>
That was the name of
<a
href="http://plasma-gate.weizmann.ac.il/Linux/maillists/02/01/msg00429.html">
a post</a> I made to the Linux-IL mailing-list, which
started quite a flamewar.
Basically, I made two suggestions for improvements to the
way the Linux kernel
was managed:


<p> <p>
<ol>
<li>
That a source control mechanism be used by Linus and the
other kernel
developers (hence the name)

<li>
That Linus will not necessarily OK all the patches that will
go into the
main kernel tree, but rather rely on the good judgement of
the subsystem
maintainers, the module maintainers, etc.

</ol>


<p> <p>
Suggestion #1 seems to have been resolved (with or without
my influence - IANA
prominent kernel developer) by Linus' switch to BitKeeper.
Suggestion #2 seems
to have been raised in the "Patch Penguin" post. I did not
thoroughly read
either the original post or Torvalds' reply to it, so I
cannot say right now
whether or not it has been resolved the way I think it should.


<p> <p>
An interesting theme to my posts was an analogy I made to
the story of Moses
and Jethero in the Exodus. Read the posts and be amused.
