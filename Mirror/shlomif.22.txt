<p><b>Vim Macro</b>

<p> <p>
Due to the fact that I could not find any decent editor
outside KDE that behaves just like I wanted, I decided to
try and make
gvim into an xmms front-end. Which naturally meant adding
two macros (one for playing a file and the other for
enqueuing it) into my .vimrc file.

<p>
I knew Vim macros were basically a recording of all the
commands needed to execute them. So, after consulting the
vim help pages a bit I came up with a <a
href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/hackers-il/message/1843">
generic macro</a> that did just that. This macro had a
problem in which it was not resistant to shell's special
characters.


<p> <p>
I worked on two other revisions of the macro. In the
<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/hackers-il/message/1909">
third revision</a> everything was fixed except for filenames
that contain newlines (which are pretty rare as it is).


<p> <p>
What I did was copy the line containing the filename into
a register, duplicate it below, substitute all the single
quotes with the sequence '\'', copy it into the register
again. Then, I entered the command line :!xmms '$reg' on the
shell, and afterwards deleted the extra line.


<p> <p>
<a href="http://users.actcom.co.il/~choo/">Guy Keren</a>
once said to me that one did not do real programming until
he programs with Vi macros. So, perhaps this was a baby step
in the direction of becoming a "real" programmer.


<p> <p>
This macro looks like line noise, doesn't it? ;-)
