<p><b>dmoz Cleanup</b>

<p> <p>
Throughout the last couple of days, I settled out on cleaning the
"Configuration Management : Tools" dmoz category. Now I'm left with 17 
pending links. Man, this takes a lot of time, but I'm almost finished with
it.


<p> <p><b>Syscalltrack's Homepage</b>

<p> <p>
I started a <a href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/games/freecell-solver-bin.html">branch in the Syscalltrack CVS</a> to implement some homepage cleanups.
Here is <a href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=2773565">a report</a> I wrote on what I did.


<p> <p>
Meanwhile, it was reported that MSIE displays the border of the navigation bar
in white instead of black. This turned out to be a bug in the CSS stylesheet in
which the text specified <tt>border-right : medium solid ; color : black;</tt>
instead of <tt>border-right : medium solid black</tt>. I also fixed it in my
branch.


<p> <p><b>KDE 3.1</b>

<p> <p>
While looking at the KDE archives, I found out that packages of KDE 3.1-RC5 for
Mandrake 9.0 were prepared. I decided to install it. The installation went
quite OK, and my new system is stable. Some bugs were eliminated from 3.0.x 
and some were added (as usual).


<p> <p>
Strangely enough, I found old bug reports of the same bugs in the 
<a href="http://bugs.kde.org/">KDE bugs tracker</a>, but then realized
they were very old. So I reported them again.


<p> <p><b>kdegames from the CVS</b>

<p> <p>
Having KDE 3.1 installed made it possible to compile the HEAD branch of kdegames
from the CVS. Took a bit to install, and the out-of-date makefiles (which I had
to run automake with) gave me some trouble. Then the DocBook documents 
absolutely refused to compile, so I removed their directory from the SUBDIRS
of the makefile. And naturally, it takes a <b>long</b> time for g++ to compile
KDE code. At the end of the day, however, I had it built and installed.


<p> <p>
This enabled me to work on kpat and integrate the changes I wanted their. I 
removed the limitation for game numbers only up to 32,000, and integrated the 
new Freecell Solver their. gcc was ran with a lot of extra flags (-ansi, 
-pedantic, -Wundef, etc.) and it spewed a lot of warnings and complained about
many things. Eventually, however, I was able to resolve them.


<p> <p>
Then, while trying to solve a game, I discovered <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/fc-solve-discuss/message/449">a bug in Freecell Solver</a> which forced me to release the 2.8.3 version of it. I fixed it in both CVS branches, and in 
the KDE integration, and now I'm back on track. What's left to do is to 
hard-code a nice command line preset into kpat, so it will have less unsolvable
games reports.


<p> <p><b>Life</b>

<p> <p>
It was raining on and off the last couple of days. On Friday morning,
there was a beautiful sunshine and I went to bike. Then it started raining in the afternoon. On Saturday it was also sunny, so I went to a walk in the morning
and biked in the afternoon. Today seems sunny as well so far.


<p> <p>
My sister Noa and Dad returned from their trip to England and the States. Noa
had a surgery which was supposed to handle her over-perspiration problem. 
They brought a lot of toys, food, books and other stuff. 


<p> <p>
Michal (my other sister) meanwhile has homework to do. In her "Intro to 
Programming" class, she had to write an C function, that removes a specified
character from a string. It can be done in O(n) time by keeping two pointers.
Today, she worked on her Linear Algebra exercises and I also helped her
a little.
