<p><b>My Home-site and Internet Explorer - a war story</b>

<p> <p> <p>
I just discovered MSIE 5.5 ignores the padding-left, padding-bottom etc. CSS styles and so the navigation bar on
<a href="http://t2.technion.ac.il/~shlomif/">my homepage</a> is indented to the right. What should I do to fix it while still keeping my homepage XHTML 1.0 Strict (or at least XHTML 1.0 Transitional)?


<p> <p> <p>
Please <a href="mailto:shlomif@vipe.technion.ac.il">E-mail me</a> if you know what to do. Meanwhile I'll start STFWing.

<a href="/person/moshez/">moshez</a>: as opposed to you I'd like my program to be useful to many people. As many as possible if you may. That's the difference between <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/FiveWorlds.html">
Shrinkwrap and an internally-used program.</a>. If you distribute a program as open-source but do not think about making it appeal to many users (I do not mean all users, but as many as you can), then it will never really take off. There are zillions of such programs that do something right, but only their author can truly understand how to use them. A real OSS fits the needs of many users, has a portable build process, a usable documentation, and a rich and growing feature-set.

Otherwise, it is just a project which happens to be distributed under an open-source license. Not something
that can compete in the market-place. If you don't feel this way about free software you right, then I don't think you
understand why it is important.


<p> <p><a href="/person/ladypine/">ladypine</a> - it's good to see something new finally coming out of you, Muli and Orr. I usually only check your diaries regularly since I personally know you and care about you. I should note that I was almost unaware of the process with making an open-source NPO. Please put the discussion in a public forum that I will know of.

As for voting: I found that Internet-polls hardly ever work.  The best way is for someone to set up a day and to accept the fact that some people won't be able to make it.
