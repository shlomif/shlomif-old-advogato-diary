<p><b>GNU Savannah and Human Engineering Cont.</b>

<p> <p>
Some of the Savannah people were not entirely happy with what
I wrote in the diary. You can find their comments and my
comments to their comments in the following threads of the
savannah-hackers mailing list:

An interesting side effect of this argument was <a
href="http://www.advogato.org/article/458.html">my
article</a> about Human Engineering and how it transcends to
actual project development. I still prefer to stay clear of
the GNU Savannah service because it seems a bit too picky to me.


<p> <p><b>BitKeeper</b>

<p> <p>
Trying to get a decent source control repository (I'd like
something a bit more sensible than CVS), I registered <a
href="http://vipe.technion.ac.il/~shlomif/lm-solve/">lm-solve</a>
at BitKeeper. After some troubles setting up the SSH key,
and bothering a support guy about it, I managed to get the
project active. I also installed the BK binary, but did not
get to populate the project yet.


<p> <p>
I have a CVS repository of the project on my local computer,
but I could not find any automated way to convert it to
BitKeeper on the site, even though it says it is possible.
The BitKeeper site could use a little re-organization.


<p> <p>
But hopefully, I would be able to work on the project from
several locations, without too much trouble.
