<p><b>Studies</b>

<p> <p>
I handed out the "Intro to Soft. Systems" exercise, a Micro-computers exercise
about MMX, and a Financial Management exercise. Now I am working on another
Financial Management exercise, and will meet with my "Intro to Soft. Systems"
partner on Monday to work on the next exercise in that subject.


<p> <p>
On Sunday, I'll meet Ran to work on the "Software Systems" exercise and
project. Last time, we ran into problems and after I talked with the T.A. it
turned out that we did not enable the interrupts functionality in the
simulator. After it was enabled everything worked fine. &lt;sigh /&gt;


<p> <p><b>Hacktivity</b>

<p> <p>
I was able to get several things done. First I created <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?mode=all&query=bundle%20quadpres">
    a QuadPres Bundle on CPAN</a> to install the modules it requires. It turns
out the dependencies of the bundle, are specified in the CONTENTS POD section
in the module, and it took me some time to figure it out.


<p> <p>
I also worked on "use strict"ing the main script of
<a href="http://chiqchaq.sourceforge.net/">the Chiq-Chaq Wiki
    Implementation</a>. I finished doing this and now I'm going
to fix the HTML to make it validate.


<p> <p><b>Perl</b>

<p> <p>
I discovered that the <tt>&lt;&gt;</tt> directive does not do the
same thing as <tt>&lt;STDIN&gt;</tt>. While the second reads from standard
input, the first one tries to open files on the command line one by one.


<p> <p>
There's also <a href="http://terje.perlgolf.org/wsp/pgas/score.pl?func=score&hole=38&season=1">a new Perl Golf - Boggle</a>. I'm doing pretty well at it -
I'm in 5th place. But there's still room for improvement and I'm stumped.


<p> <p><b>Life</b>

<p> <p>
My sister Noa has gone abroad the night before yesterday. She will be there
for three monthes on a trip to South America.
