<p><b>Exercising</b>

<p> <p>
My bike broke again last Friday, which made it impossible 
for me to ride them in the further part of the weekend. This 
has finally convinced my father to buy me a new bicycle. 


<p> <p>
My father and I went on a hiking trip on Saturday. We walked
in a narrow water-less channel, which did not have too many flowers
or interesting trees. The road up to it looked nicer than the 
road inside, IMO, but it was good to have a trip back again.


<p> <p>
It's been constanly raining here since the weekend, so I could 
not jog even assuming I would want to do that. Maybe, I'll go to the
gym today, or tomorrow...


<p> <p><b>Technion Courses</b>

<p> <p>
Things are not going very well with Game Theory and with 
"Intro to Thermodynamics and Statistical Physics". In Game Theory
I missed a few lectures due to these wretched Real-Time DSP experiments
and was not very successful in solving the home exercises on my own.
In Thermo, I missed a few lectures and T.A. sessions and also have a 
learning gap.


<p> <p>
I called a tutor for Thermo and he said he was busy this week and 
that I should phone him on Thursday. There are no tutors for 
Game Theory unfortunately, but I'm going to consult with the lecturer
today about the situation.

<p> <p>
I hacked on it a bit in the past few days. Right now there is a 
working man page with many aliases for every function it contains. Took me some 
Autotools games to put the man page on a separate directory.


<p> <p>
I also combined release_write() and release_read() into one function.


<p> <p><b>Misc Stuff</b>

<p> <p>
vipe.technion.ac.il has been inaccesible for some time but is now. 
I wonder why does the dorms network causes me so much trouble.


<p> <p>
I forgot my cell-phone at home. At times, I feel the urge to call people
using it. Maybe I'm becoming too technocratic...
