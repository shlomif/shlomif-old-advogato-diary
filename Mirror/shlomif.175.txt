<p><b>Computer Woos (2)</b>

<p> <p> <p> <p>
It turns out the Windows hard drive got damaged as well, along with all the
data that was present there. Now, we have to find if the new Linux hard-disk
is OK, because it was present in the computer as well when the accident
happened. It's not too critical because I only used it for a day and I
have everything that was placed on it (except for a few IRC logs) backed up.


<p> <p> <p> <p><b>Hacktivity</b>

<p> <p> <p> <p>
With my limited resources, there's not too much I can do. However, I did
work on the version control systems comparison, and today was able to
translate one chapter out of "Homesteading the Noosphere".


<p> <p> <p> <p><b>Upcoming Linux Events</b>

<p> <p> <p> <p>
There was a Haifux meeting today in which Shimon Panfil gave a lecture
about Tcl/Tk. I wanted to come, but Ori Idan, who was supposed to give me
rides there, could not go eventually, and I preferred not to telecomute
by public transportation.


<p> <p> <p> <p>
Tomorrow there's a Linux meeting at a cafe in "Yehuda Halevi" St. in
Tel-Aviv, and I intend to come. Next, I give
<a href="http://vipe.technion.ac.il/~shlomif/lecture/Gimp/">a lecture
about the Gimp</a> for the Tel-Aviv Linux Club on Sunday. And a week and a
day from then, Aviram Jenik will give a lecture about Spam to Haifux.


<p> <p> <p> <p><b>Reading</b>

<p> <p> <p> <p>
I made some progress in "Programming Web Services with Perl". And I also
listened to <a href="http://catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/linux1.d50.ra">the stand-up version of the Cathedral and the Bazaar</a>. The latter
is very amusing.

<p> <p> <p><b>Certification</b>

<p> <p> <p>
I looked for an Advogato Subversion project and found it: <a href="/proj/Subversion/">Subversion</a>. So I designated myself a contributor to it. Then, I noticed Ben Collins-Sussman was
a member of it, so I certified him as Journeyer. That's it!
