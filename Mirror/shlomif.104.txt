<p><b>Better SCM</b>

<a href="http://better-scm.berlios.de/">The Better SCM</a>
has materialized throughout the weekend, and looks pretty nice now. I copied the same look and feel as the Freecell
Solver site, but might play with the CSS stuff soon.

My notice about the BitKeeper essays was rejected from Slashdot. This time I anticipated it, and was not very disappointed. Then I posted an announcement about it to the Linux Kernel mailing list, which now appears in their archives. Someone contacted me about it, but it was about my signature. Still, I hope Larry McVoy will read it and think about it a little.
