<p><b>Studies</b>

<p> <p> <p>
In the "Software Systems" front, my partner and I showed our presentation
to the lecturer, and he had some issues with it. To resolve it we sat on
it on Thursday, and revamped it greatly. We sent him the modified version,
but did not hear from him since.


<p> <p> <p>
Right now I have homework pending in Financial Management, and in
Micro-computers. The latter I only have 20% of the score left to do as I
alredy did the wet part.


<p> <p> <p>
I attended the various lectures and tutorials given this week. In the Software
Systems lecture, a student gave a presentation on a device he wrote using
Blue-tooth and a TI DSP, and the lecturer told us about what the company
he founded deals with. (connecting variable data sources together to integrate
information)


<p> <p> <p><b>Hacktivity</b>

<p> <p> <p>
I gave some touches to the list of mailing lists manager. I had to fix the
build, and integrated building an RPM Spec. I also worked on Quad-Pres a
little. Since I needed to render the presentations into HTML that is
viewable on the hard-disk, I created a script that does just that. All
it does is append <tt>index.html</tt> to links to directories. At home
, I extracted it into a module, and placed it on CPAN.


<p> <p> <p>
I called it HTML::Hard::Disk. However, I received a reply to the namespace
request that was sent to the CPAN module maintainers list, in which someone
claimed it was not a good name. He suggested HTML::LocalizeLinks, and
I think I'll go with HTML::Links::Localize.


<p> <p> <p>
In any case, I integrated its functionality into Quad-Pres, and will
probably release a new development version, and announce it on Freshmeat.

<p> <p><b>Bug in perl</b>

<p> <p>
A certain "hidihi" I talked to on EFnet's #perlhelp IRC channel yesterday, discovered <a href="http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2003-06/msg00653.html">a bug in perl</a>. I brought this bug in perl5-porters, and other people there
also thought it was a bug, and Adrian Enache also gave a patch for it.


<p> <p>
The bug involves expressions of the kind <tt>($c .= "5") . "6"</tt> where "6"
is also concatenated into $c. It seems to have existed since perl 5.000 (!).
