<p><b>Studies</b>

<p> <p>
I had two tests one in each subject I'm taking this semester. The Thermodynamics
test went pretty well, but I'm not entirely sure I did it perfectly. I'll see
what my grade will be.


<p> <p>
Yesterday, I had a test in Statistics. It went so-so, and I had difficulties
with some sections. Nonetheless, both tests just protect the main score from 
the main test, so they are not critical.


<p> <p>
I had a relatively hectic few couple of days. On Monday, I had to get up early
to attend the Statistics lessons (as usual), and in the evening I had a Haifux
meeting, which meant I arrived home late. On Tuesday, I had the test in 
Statistics from 17:30 to 19:30, and I returned home again, and went to sleep 
at about 10:30 PM. And today (Wednesday) I had to get up early and go to the
Thermodynamics lessons. But I'm glad it's over and now I have an extended 
weekend in front of me.


<p> <p><b>Perl Meeting</b>

<p> <p>
I had a Perl Meeting last Thursday. I went there by bus and had to walk. When
I came there, there were few people there and not too many joined us. But it
was fun. Before the meeting, Ran collected money from everybody and we went
together to buy the snacks. Then the presentations started.


<p> <p>
Shlomo Yona gave a presentation about the Perl Garbage Collector. I could not
say he renewed too much to me. (except in telling that the Java garbage 
collector supported distributed GC). Still, it was a very good and fun lecture.
It was followed by a small demo by Ran Eilam. He demonstrated how he started
from the Java test in Eclipse, and gradually wrote the rest of the code with
the help of the IDE that did a lot of code writing for him. We concluded that
it would be very difficult to do it with Perl, because it's a more complex 
langauge and such that is much less easy to manipulate.


<p> <p>
Then, some people had to leave and could not hear me give the <a href="http://vipe.technion.ac.il/~shlomif/lecture/Perl/Haskell/slides/">presentation on Haskell</a>. The audience asked many questions during the lecture, and I had to 
explain some of the simpler examples in detail. Eventually, I ran out of time
and skipped some of the more complex ones. But it went quite well, albeit
I'm not sure how many understood it.


<p> <p>
During the meeting, I returned the "Writing Perl Modules for CPAN" book and
took the "Perl and XML" book (by O'Reilly) which was something that someone
returned. 


<p> <p>
Afterwards, the guys decided to go to the bar, including the one who was 
supposed to give me a ride. I decided to skip it as I was tired and found
a ride with Thomas Maier. On the road, we talked about his job and my 
educational/employment status.


<p> <p>
Ran Eilam wrote a <a href="http://perl.org.il/kwiki/index.cgi?MeetingReport2003Dec11">meeting 
    report</a> on the new Israeli Perl Mongers Wiki.


<p> <p><b>Haifux Meeting</b>

<p> <p>
On Monday, Aviram Jenik gave <a href="http://www.haifux.org/lectures/82/">a 
    presentation about Spam</a> to the Haifa Linux Club. The presentation was
very entertaining and fun, with many interruptions from the audience to 
discuss the dynamics of Spam and how to deal with it. I was especially amused
by the "Time Traveller stuck in 2003" junk-mail he received.


<p> <p>
After the Meeting, Aviram gave a ride to Tzafrir Cohen and me until the Netanya
Junction. I called Dad on the way, and he drove us from there to Tel-Aviv.


<p> <p><b>Reading</b>

<p> <p>
I finished reading Mary Poppins. It's a very nice book, and I might order
the sequels if I feel like it. I also read more of "Extending and Embedding
Perl". I also read things I found on the web like 
<a href="http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2003/12/11/myths.html">myths 
    open source developers tell ourselves.</a>


<p> <p><b>Hacktivity</b>

<p> <p>
I added some idioms to the page in progress of 
<a href="http://perl-begin.berlios.de/cgi-bin/chiq_chaq/chiq.pl?Idiomatic_Perl">Idiomatic
    Perl</a>. The Wiki implementation gave me some trouble and sometimes 
reported the page has changed during its editing, which it didn't.


<p> <p>
I also added some things to the newly set up 
<a href="http://perl.org.il/kwiki/index.cgi">Israeli Perl Mongers Kwiki</a>:
<a href="http://perl.org.il/kwiki/index.cgi?IsraeliProjects">a page for Israeli
    Perl Projects</a> which is now more up to date than the one at the regular 
site. (I imported all the existing content there); and I also started
<a href="http://perl.org.il/kwiki/index.cgi?BookReviews">a book reviews 
    section</a>, where I place my book reviews without having to wait for
the webmaster.


<p> <p>
I also downloaded and installed the latest GIMP 1.3.x and played with it
a bit. It's very impressive and polished, but so far it seems that the Script-Fu
logos scripts got broken. This may have been fixed according to a message
I saw in its developers list.
