<p><b>Wine Lecture at Telux</b>

<p> <p> <p>
The Sunday before the last, Shachar Shemesh gave a re-run of his lecture about
Wine to the Tel Aviv Linux Club. This time, the lecture was more polished than
the time he gave it on Haifux. He threw a lot of funny jokes throughout the
lecture and it was very entertaining. Shachar is a great lecturer.


<p> <p> <p>
Next I have a <a href="http://www.perl.org.il/20031211.html">Perl-IL
    meeting</a>, with presentations by three people including me. In the Haifux
front, there was a meeting yesterday of a post-mortem to the
Welcome-to-Linux series. I could not attend it because of an exam I had (see
below). In any case, next week, Aviram Jenik will give a lecture about Spam,
which I look forward to.


<p> <p> <p><b>Studies</b>

<p> <p> <p>
I had to hand out three statistics homework sheets yesterday. Two exercises
gave me some trouble. One of them was tackled, but the other - a very similar
one yielded a solution that was similar to the correct one but not identical.
I ended up handing it as is because I could not find what the trouble was,
despite the long hours of staring.


<p> <p> <p>
Otherwise, I had an exam in Thermodynamics yesterday at 18:30. It came out
quite convenient to me because I study that day and plus my father had a
conference at the Technion, so he could give me a ride there and back. I woke
up early so I was quite sleepy throughout the day, but during the exam
I was OK. The exam was not too hard, but I'm not sure I did all the
exercises correctly. I'll see what my score is.


<p> <p> <p><b>Yapcom</b>

<p> <p> <p>
I finally got Yapcom to work. As expected it turned out to be a problem in
which the E-mail could not be sent. After that was fixed everything worked.
Still it is a bug.


<p> <p> <p>
Meanwhile, I bugged the other developers with comments about the PATH_INFO
environment variable and other such things.


<p> <p> <p><b>IGLU Jobs Tracker</b>

<p> <p> <p>
I implemented an ad-hoc administration screen that so far only displays
the records with some inactive links. Now I have to restrict it to a
a certain logon, which would take some work. Having done it, I was glad
I used Template::Toolkit because I was able to extend the template of
the job to display the links.


<p> <p> <p>
I talked with Eran on the ICQ about it and he gave some useful commentary
which I may choose to implement.


<p> <p> <p><b>Reading</b>

<p> <p> <p>
Read some more of "Extending and Embedding Perl". The book is not too
interesting so far, but I suppose it can prove useful if I need to write
a Perl extension.


<p> <p> <p>
I also read another chapter of Mary Poppins. Maybe I should get myself
to read more fiction.


<p> <p> <p><b>Dmoz</b>

<p> <p> <p>
Another day - more pending links. Only this time, I was able to clean
the pending links out of the User Groups category. Now, all I have to do
is add all the remaining groups there. Guess, it's time for the editorial
about it.


<p> <p> <p><b>fc-solve-discuss</b>

<p> <p> <p>
There was quite a lot of action recently in <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/fc-solve-discuss/">fc-solve-discuss</a>. It started when Danny A. Jones
posted some questions that were raised after he wrote a Breadth-First-Search
Freecell Solver to find optimal or near-optimal solutions for Freecell. Then
it took on a more active tangent when Eric Helser posted some question on how
to actually write a solver, as he had problem doing so. So, the guys and I
helped him.


<p> <p> <p>
I hope this trend goes on.
