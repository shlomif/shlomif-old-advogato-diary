<p><b>Studies</b>

<p> <p> <p>
I stayed in Haifa last weekend, so Eran and I can work on
preparing the Lab 3 assignments in advance. It took us a
very long time to solve anything, but we managed to finish
the "Image Processing" and part of the "Computer Networks"
experiments. Right now, Passover started, so I have till the
Sunday after the next.

Studies were quite interesting the past two weeks. In
"Computer Graphics" the lecturer gave us an overview of the
book "The Psychology of Everyday Things" so we can design
better UIs. My partner for "Design and Analysis of
Algorithms" and I sat on the first assignment and managed to
finish it. (I consulted the T.A. regarding one exercise there).

Solving the "SICP 2" exercises on streams proved to be quite
enlightening. There are many tricks that can be done
efficiently using such delayed lists.


<p> <p><b>The New Project</b>

<p> <p>
Roy and I's new project has to do with writing a web-based
front-end for viewing and managing Technion Seminars. Roy
and I spent some time writing a SPEC and site workflows of
it. Our supervisor (who also happens to be the lab engineer
and a T.A. in some courses), many times did not have too
much time to meet with us. (sometimes despite the fact that
we scheduled with him in advance) Hopefully, we won't rely
on him too much as we start working on the project.
