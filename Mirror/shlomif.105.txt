<p><b>WMA vs. Mp3 vs. Ogg vs. the world</b>

<p> <p>
Eran's parents have a Windows XP Computer, and would like to use it to play
Music out of a speaker. They have a large collection of CD's (several hundreds)
and Eran wants to track them all into mp3's or something similar, put them 
on the computer's hard-disk, and play them into oblivion. The problem is that 
his parents are not computer "gurus" so to speak.

He said that he downloaded <a href="http://www.musicmatch.com/">MusicMatch</a>, 
but that it keeps crashing or hanging. This is interesting because on my home
shaky Windows 98 system, MusicMatch works very nicely. Then he said, the 
Windows Media Player knows how to track CD's into WMA's extra fine, but that
it refuses to create mp3's out of them. He asked me how are WMA's different 
than mp3's, and I could only tell him that I believed they were a proprietary
Microsoft format of better quality than normal mp3's and may not playback on 
Linux, without crazy Wine games.

When we returned to Com-Net, we searched Google for it. "WMA" returned absolute
junk (as can be expected from most 3-letter initials). But "WMA Windows Audio"
returned <a href="http://www.litexmedia.com/">Litex Media</a> as the first 
link. They are a shareware vendor and the site is very good looking yet 
functional (works fine in Konqueror 3.0.4), and contains an "Audio Formats 
Comparison Article". This gave us a useful 
<a href="http://www.litexmedia.com/article/audio_formats.html">Overview</a>
of the Audio Formats around.

Another thing we discovered there was that they ship a program called "Fast CD
Ripper" that can convert CD's into mp3's (or WMA's or Oggs for that matter)
and is said to be fully compatible with Windows XP. All in all, I was very 
impressed. I'm still intrigued why Music Match does not like XP (or vice versa)
, but then again XP is not a very stable system.

If you were scared away by the Windowisms here, you can return now.
