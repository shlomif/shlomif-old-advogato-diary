 is progressing nicely. Roy and I finished writing the 
parser and began writing the translator and the 
arbitrator. But there is still a lot of work ahead of us, 
so I decided to dedicate next weekend for working on it

I released Freecell Solver 1.8.0 yesterday. It took a lot 
of trial and error to tweak GNU Autotools to do the right

I reached a relatively dead end for the R2L KDE Applet. 
The only responce I received in my post to the kde-devel

it, and wait for an answer and see if it helps.

I'd like to start preparing for the "Image Processing and 
Analysis" exam today, so I don't know how much time I can 
dedicate for hacking.
