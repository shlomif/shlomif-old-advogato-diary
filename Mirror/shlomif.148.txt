<p><b>Studies</b>

<p> <p>
I sat on the "Financial Management" exercise this weekend, and met with
my partner on Monday and was able to finalize it then. I also worked on the
Micro-computers exercise. I solved Questions 1,3,4 but I don't know how to
solve question 2. Maybe my partner will have a better luck.


<p> <p>
This Tuesday my partner for Software Systems and I sat on the project and
the third home exercise. We finished an implementation for one part of the
project, and also part of the home exercise. We should meet tomorrow as well.


<p> <p>
There is now a vacation that started on Tuesday and will end at the Weekend,
due to the Israeli Independence Day and so on.


<p> <p><b>Hebrew Glossary for Perl</b>

<p> <p>
I started writing a <a href="http://perl-begin.berlios.de/Heb-Glossary/">Hebrew
    Glossary for Perl</a>. I wrote it in XML format and it took me some time
to learn the Perl XML::LibXML module to get it to render it into HTML. Then,
I also wrote a DTD for it, and prepared an XSLT stylesheet.


<p> <p>
When I tried to view the XML in Mozilla, I got a blank page. I spent the better
part of yesterday trying to get it to work. The problem turned out to be
in the "Content-Type" HTTP header that the browser sent for the .xsl file, 
which wasn't "text/xml" as it should have been. After I fixed it using a short 
.htaccess file, it worked perfectly. &lt;sigh /&gt;


<p> <p>
So I filed a <a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=204748">bug report for it</a> 
in the Mozilla Bugzilla but it was closed, because that's what should happen. 
&lt;sigh /&gt; again.
