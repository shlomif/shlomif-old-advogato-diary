<p><b>Subversion and Neon Verdict</b>

<p> <p>
At the end, the Subversion maintainer told us we can use the HTTP error code
to distinguish between the different kind of errors Neon is returning. So I
wrote an <a href="http://www.contactor.se/~dast/svn/archive-2003-07/1500.shtml">updated patch</a> and Ben Collins-Sussman commited it. (thanks, Ben!). Now,
there's a part of me in the Subversion core.


<p> <p><b>LM-Solve Re-work</b>

<p> <p>
I spent part of the last couple of days reworking <a href="/proj/LM-Solve/">LM-Solve</a>. I
started out <a href="http://stalker.iguide.co.il:8080/svn/lm-solve/">a
    Subversion repository for it</a>, changed its namespace to "Games::LMSolve",
added a lot of documentation, etc. It's also in CPAN now.


<p> <p><b>Studies</b>

<p> <p>
I took the test of Micro-computers on Wednesday. It went pretty well. I was
first worried that I won't have enough time to finish it, but then it turned
out I did have, even without the time extension. I still don't know what
my score is. This is my last test for this semester, so now I'm <b>free</b>!.


<p> <p><b>Subversion</b>

<p> <p>
I submitted a patch to add a <tt>--config-dir</tt> option to the subversion
command line clients to specify an alternate directory for the configuration
files. The first incarnation became out of date after a change in the code.
The <a href="http://www.contactor.se/~dast/svn/archive-2003-07/1666.shtml">second
    one</a> was also more encompassing, and modified more configuration
commands. I still have a small queue of patches that did not get accepted yet.
