This diary entry is now cross-posted to Live Journal. At the moment, manually,
but I plan to write an automated cross-poster.


<p> <p><b>OpenOffice.org bug</b>

<p> <p>
I sent my C.V. to someone and he told me the parenthesis were reversed there.
Turns out the OpenOffice.org export to PDF is faulty again, and it reversed
the parenthesis. I filed <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=36724">a bug report of it</a>. Meanwhile, I wrote my Hebrew C.V. in HTML
format, which worked very well, without any bugs.


<p> <p><b>CPANPLUS</b>

<p> <p>
While smoking CPAN, I had problems installing the
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Test-URI/">Test-URI</a> module. The
developer claimed it was a bug in the CPANPLUS module. I tried to investigate,
and hopefully correct it. Then, however it turned out the module was marked
as a developer release (where no regular module was available). This is what
prevented it from being indexed by CPANPLUS, as it was not in the module
list.

<p> <p><b>Perl Empty Regex Catch</b>

<p> <p>
Check
<a href="http://perl.org.il/pipermail/perl/2004-November/006240.html">this
    post I made to Israel.PM for a Perl catch regarding matching the empty
    regex</a>. I encountered it while working on my navigation menu module.


<p> <p><b>Helping someone with his Linux System</b>

<p> <p>
I helped someone called Amir who approached me on the Telux meetings, and said
he had some problems with his Linux system. (X won't start). So I went to
help him bringing with me a Knoppix disc. His problem was that X couldn't
start. It was Mandrakelinux 10.0, and the startx program reported a missing
symbolic link. After I fixed the link, it still wasn't good enough, and I
had to play a bit with XFdrake, which is the Mandrake X configuration tool.


<p> <p>
After that, we were able to start X, and we needed to connect to the Internet.
He had a modem dial-up connection, and so, I played a bit with the Mandrake
Control Center, and we were able to start it. Then, I explained to him a bit
about Mozilla firefox, urpmi, etc. All in all, the mission was accomplished,
and his system worked.


<p> <p><b>SVN::RaWeb::Light</b>

<p> <p>
Berlios.de only gives Subversion access via the svn:// protocol. So I wanted
a web-interface to visualize things like is present in the http:// hosting.
I looked for things like this, only there were either only for a local
repository or presented too much information and so took a long time to
process a page.


<p> <p>
So I wrote my own module,
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/SVN-RaWeb-Light/">SVN-RaWeb-Light</a>.
It behaves much like the one for the Subversion hosting, but has a useful
improvement, of being able to display different revisions of the repository
using the <tt>rev</tt> CGI parameter.


<p> <p>
I was able to use it on my computer to view the Berlios repository. It's a bit
slow, but still much better than anything else I've tried. I plan to implement
caching of the data next.


<p> <p><b>Mail on Vipe</b>

<p> <p>
Strangely enough, the mail directory I had on vipe was gone. I had to restore
it from a backup on my computer by transferring the compressed directory there.
Afterwards, I discovered that not too much was lost.


<p> <p><b>libtool/autoconf problem</b>

<p> <p>
Someone reported a problem with one of the header files of Freecell Solver. To
resolve it, I had to modify it and rebuild it. Only the rebuild failed.
Autoconf complained that some of the macros were deprecated. It turned out
support for Autoconf 2.1x was removed from the libtool m4 macros some time ago.
So, I had to upgrade to Autoconf 2.5x, just to build the distribution. I spent
an entire evening on this, on what should have been a simple change. Autoconf
must die!


<p> <p><b>HTML::Strip::Whitespace</b>

<p> <p>
When I was working on <a href="http://www.perl.org.il/">the Israeli Perl
    Mongers site</a> I noticed that the HTML had a lot of extraneous
whitespace. I've looked in CPAN for a module that will do the job, but
the only module I found (HTML-Clean) could damage whitespace inside
&lt;pre&gt; blocks. So I wrote one of my own -
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/HTML-Strip-Whitespace/">HTML::Strip::Whitespace</a>.

<p>
As it turned out, htmltidy can strip whitespace out of HTML. The webmaster of
perl.org.il, however, insisted that the HTML on the site should be carefully
indented, instead of whitespace-stripped and smaller, so I don't have an
immediate use for this module.


<p> <p><b>Music Downloading</b>

<p> <p>
I tried to download the song "Tears on My Pillow" performed by Kylie Minogue.
(which I have on cassette). However, almost all of the mp3 files I downloaded
had a completely different song, only with the title I requested. What the
hell?


<p> <p>
Eventually, however, I was able to find one good version of it.


<p> <p><b>Disabling "Unsubscribe" in ezmlm</b>

<p> <p>
I wanted to form a mailing list for my beta reviewers, so I and the
other members can send E-mail to one address and it will arrive to everybody.
The problem is that I did not want anyone to be able to subscribe to there.


<p> <p>
I searched and searched for it and eventually found <a href="http://66.102.9.104/search?q=cache:522XFhFmM7QJ:www.geocrawler.com/archives/3/505/2003/3/0/10399823/+ezmlm+%22reject+subscribe%22&hl=en">this
    post to a mailing list about ezmlm that explained how to do it.</a>


<p> <p><b>Job Hunting News</b>

<p> <p>
It turns out several people contacted my cell-phone and left messages, and
I had no idea about it because I did not check it. So I called them back.


<p> <p>
In any case, I had two job interviews for
<a href="http://www.10levels.com/">a company called
    "10 Levels"</a> and they eventually decided to hire me. So I worked
for them yesterday and today. What I had to do was write some Perl scripts
to automate an application written using PowerBuilder. I was able to do some
of the tasks, but not the last one. I have a Win32 form with several fields,
and I have to fill in the required fields. However, I cannot find a way to
switch the focus to the second field. SetFocus() doesn't work.
SetActiveWindow() doesn't work and neither does a simulated mouse click.


<p> <p>
I also installed Windows XP and RHEL 3 on a computer today. Configuring the
networking involved doing a few physical pluggings. Then I wanted to install
packages of Red Hat Enterprise Linux from the command line. I tried installing
apt and everything, but it could not install packages from the RedHat CDs.
After talking with people on the IRC, I found out that with RHEL, I need to
pay for a subscription for up2date to get the packages. (and cannot use apt
or yum). What the hell?


<p> <p>
I asked one of my superiors what to do, and it turns out he did not realize
you could resolve the dependencies of a package from the command line (he told
me to look for the package in rpmfind.net, download it and install it using
the rpm command). He also thought one did not need to pay for RHEL.
