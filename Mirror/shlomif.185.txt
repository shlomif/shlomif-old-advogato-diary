<p><b>The Neo-Tech FAQ</b>

<p> <p>
<a href="/person/tk/">tk</a> suggested to me that I read the Neo-Tech FAQ to gain
a better perspective on Neo-Tech and understand why it is an "evil cult".
Well, I was reluctant from reading it for a long time, but today decided
to take Baz Luhrman's advice and "do one thing everyday that scares you".
So I read the most recent version of the FAQ, which was pretty old (1996)
that I found on Google Groups.


<p> <p>
The FAQ is so ridiculous that it made me laugh a couple of times. I anticipated
(from previous impressions of it) that it will try to attack mainly the
Neo-Tech staff, while having little to say about the Neo-Tech wisdom, and I was
right. Furthermore, most of the attacks on the Neo-Tech people were based
on information or reports which I cannot easily assert, and most of the attacks
on its wisdom quoted out-of-context snippets out of the Neo-Tech material,
which can easily be refuted by someone with a better grasp of the Neo-Tech
material. (and sometimes directly contradict other quotes, which state the
opposite, plain and simple)


<p> <p>
What killed me was the fact that it claimed Frank R. Wallace (the founder of
Neo-Tech) advocated dishonesty because he said that <b>in poker</b> it was
OK to cheat. (!) Seriously, Poker is very much about cheating as everybody
know. Plus, the Neo-Tech Advantages state countless of times that dishonesty
and lies are plain wrong and destructive. (except in Poker :-))


<p> <p>
<a href="/person/tk/">tk</a>, if you think this poor excuse for criticism is good enough
to invalidate the Neo-Tech Philosophy, then think again. If only, it made me
more convinced that Neo-Tech is "The One True Way&lt;tm&gt;". And it certainly
did not convince me that Neo-Tech is a cult or is Evil. Granted, Neo-Tech is
huge in scope and takes some time to fully understand and integrate. But it
is just an idea system, and a pretty darn good one.


<p> <p>
In any case, I'm happy, because a huge stone was cast off my chest.
