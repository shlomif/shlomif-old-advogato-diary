<p><b>Life</b>

<p> <p>
Still raining on and off, so not much biking for me. I'm spending a lot of
time on the IRC lately, but still can get some useful work. Besides, when
I start studying again this Monday, IRC would not be as accessible and much
less recommended. So I'd better make the best use of it now. And even wasting
time is good if you're enjoying it. ;-)


<p> <p>
My father and I went to buy a new desk lamp for my Haifa apartment, right
before he went to England. The light bulb holder there is broken, and so
the room would be completely dark without it. Mom and I are going to set
things up in the Haifa Apartment this weekend. At the time being, I don't
spend too much time thinking about studying, but I suppose it will occupy
quite a lot of my time, soon. Hopefully, this semester, should not be too
hard.


<p> <p><b>Hacktivity</b>

<p> <p>
Worked a bit on <a href="http://www.iglu.org.il/shlomif/perl-begin/">my
    version of the Perl beginners portal</a>, a bit on revamping the perl 5
perl*.pod man pages, and some on
<a href="http://fc-solve.berlios.de/oss-fs/docbook/">DocBookifying
    the OSS/FS document</a>. I ran into a few problems with the PDF generation
of DocBook (namely that Hyperlinks and footnotes are not functional), and I
hope the good people of the DocBook-apps mailing list would help me soon.


<p> <p><b>Some IRC, E-mail, etc. Musings</b>

<p> <p>
<a href="/person/riel/">riel</a> is <a href="http://surriel.com/nh.shtml">moving out to
    New Hampshire</a>, while being in Brazil at the moment. The link is quite
informative, so I suggest you read it if you are wondering about this issue. He also confirmed the fact that the core Connectiva distribution was open-source,
much like RedHat, Mandrake or Debian. According to LWN, some non-free
distributions proved to be a bit risky after they become defunct. Suse and
Caldera are doing fine, but I still would not trust them.


<p> <p>
I noticed a certain pattern with the #perl channels on the IRC. In EF-Net,
#perl is reserved for expert talk and no CGI/Web/Net::IRC/newbie questions
are allowed. That is reserved for #perlhelp. Of course, a lot of newbies
log on to the IRC seeking perl help, and go to #perl, and without reading
the subject-line (Rule #2 of GUI design: people don't read!), ask one of
those common questions there. And I instinctively try to help them, only
that both of us get flamed later on.


<p> <p>
I think it would have been a better idea to create a #perlguru channel
and designate #perl as a channel for everything including newbie questions. In
Undernet, there's this permanent profile with a few scripts, that bans anybody
who mentions the word CGI... I was eventually banned after using "c g i" and
"c**" and posting a perfectly innocent URL. Again, something that could be
remedied by designating #perl as a channel that accepts Newbie questions.


<p> <p>
This all reminds me of Linux-IL and how newbie questions used to cause a lot
of flamatory reactions. I think the situation is much better now there in this
regard.


<p> <p>
I visited #iglu at EF-net as well, which is the channel of the Israeli Group
of Linux Users. I had a pleasant chat there. Someone asked me about Perl's
XML writing capabilites, and I asked him what was wrong with <tt>print</tt>.
Eventually it turned out he was used to a Visual Basic API that made sure
the written file was a valid XML at each point. I.e: by appending all the
closed tags to the end of the file. This requires an extra overhead, and I'm
not sure is a good idea. (in a worst case scenario, it can increase writing
from O(n) to O(n^2) for a UNIX file-system) Even so, implementing such an
object should not be too hard.


<p> <p> I managed to help someone, I met on the IRC with a Perl CGI script he
needed to write, and ended up writing the entire script and a form to power it
for him. Which wasn't hard because all he needed to do was append a line to a
file. It eventually turned out he was an Israeli, and we ended up chatting some
more.

<p> <p>
Finally, a <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/linux-il@cs.huji.ac.il/msg26163.html">flame-war broke out in Linux-IL</a>
regarding whether we as Linux developers should be considerate of the needs
of Windows users as well. (e.g: use PDF instead of PostScript, maintain a port
of the software to Windows). I'll let you be the judge.
