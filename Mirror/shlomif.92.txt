<p><b>Makefile.PL in Autoconf Cont.</b>

<p> <p> <p>
I was finally able to resolve the problem by overriding
the <tt>distdir</tt> target and replacing there one macro (I believe it was called <tt>$(DISTVNAME)</tt>) with the one
passed to it by the Autotools process.

<p> <p> <p>
It took me several days to figure this solution, and I still
consider it a kludge.

Guess now I won't be able to toy with BitKeeper at all. How much paranoid can you get? Now I'll have to see what Linus Torvalds and his friends make of this.
