<p><b>Dmoz</b>

<p> <p>
Cleanup is complete! The "CM :: Tools" category now has 4 pending links and
they are all inside the CVS sub-category which I cannot edit. Now I can
focus on other things, and just login into dmoz occasionally to see if
new links were submitted.


<p> <p><b>Hacktivity</b>

<p> <p>
Yesterday I worked a little on Quad-Pres (turned exceptions into classes
and wrote a TODO list). I also worked on getting a Freecell Solver command
line preset into kpat and wrote two scripts to do that in the process. Then
I discovered an incompatibility of the command line interface: it changed
a <tt>char *</tt> argument, which I passed from a global constant. I changed its
code in the KDE CVS and now it is working. In any case, I think it is
a good idea I change the relevant places to <tt>const char *</tt>.


<p> <p><b>Reading</b>

<p> <p>
Since I last updated you, I read several Camel Book chapters. I'm now in the
middle of Security. Besides that I also started reading the
<a href="http://www.namesys.com/whitepaper.html">Namesys Future Vision</a>
paper which I've been referred to by several people. I admit that I did not
fully understand it. And now I also read the latest Linux Weekly News edition,
and several documents that were referred there.


<p> <p><b>Life</b>

<p> <p>
My bike broke when I drove it on Saturday. Apparently, the chair fell down and
blocked the handle that enables to lower and upper it. When my father came
home yesterday's evening he was finally able to fix it, and brought the chair
to its right height. Now I can ride it again.


<p> <p>
He did notice that I was out of air. The problem is that I don't think
the current air pump I use is very good, and I have troubles using it.
